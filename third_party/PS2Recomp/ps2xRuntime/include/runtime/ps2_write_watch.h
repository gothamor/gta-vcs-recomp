// [gta-recomp] Which 4 KB pages of guest RAM were written, without reading them (docs/FULLY_NATIVE.md step 4): guest RAM
// is allocated with the OS's write watch (Windows MEM_WRITE_WATCH: every write counts - guest code, host threads, the
// kernel reading a file into it - and costs nothing until asked). fold() takes the pages written since the last fold and
// bumps their generation; a page whose generation is unchanged holds the bytes it held then. Kept out of ps2_memory.h:
// the generated code includes that one.
//
// PS2X_WRITE_WATCH=0: guest RAM allocated as before; enabled() false, every generation 0 (nothing can be told clean).
// Linux (userfaultfd async write-protect + PAGEMAP_SCAN, ps2_write_watch.cpp) is opt-in: PS2X_WRITE_WATCH=1.
// PS2X_WRITE_WATCH_LOG=1: pages written per fold and the fold's cost, every 5 s.
