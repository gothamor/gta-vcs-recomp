// embedded GSCpuBackend (everything but drawing), turns primitives into batched draws, decodes textures
// (cached) and hands each frame's command list over at VBlank. The main thread executes the lists on the
// window's RHI device (render targets, depth, blending, alpha test, fog) and shows the display circuit.

// PS2X_GS=hw selects it. PS2X_HW_SCALE=<1..8> renders at that multiple of the PS2 resolution.
