// [gta-recomp] Performance instrumentation.
//
// Every game frame (or VBlank, if the game never marks frames) becomes one sample: wall time, the EE thread's time
// split into phases (game code / render submit / IOP / waiting), render counters, host-side frame and GL times and
// the audio buffer state. In game, the settings menu's Advanced page turns the overlay (numbers + frame-time graph) on
// and records samples to logs/perf_<date>_<time>.csv. PS2X_PERF_LOG=<file.csv> records from boot (plus a "[perf]"
// summary line on stderr every 5 s) - for scripted runs; tools/perf_report.py summarises a recording.
