// Every game frame (or VBlank, if the game never marks frames) becomes one sample: wall time, the EE thread's time
// split into phases (game code / render submit / IOP / waiting), render counters, host-side frame and GL times and
// the audio buffer state. In game:
//   F3  toggle the overlay (numbers + frame-time graph)
//   F4  start / stop recording samples to perf_<date>_<time>.csv in the working directory
// PS2X_PERF_LOG=<file.csv> records from boot (plus a "[perf]" summary line on stderr every 5 s) - for scripted runs;
// tools/perf_report.py summarises a recording.
