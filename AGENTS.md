# AGENTS.md - working on the GTA: Vice City Stories native port

Read this first. It is the contract for anyone (human or AI agent) changing this repository. The
detailed knowledge lives in `docs/`:

| Doc | What's in it |
|---|---|
| [docs/game-internals.md](docs/game-internals.md) | Everything known about how the game works inside: code map, boot, camera, renderer, VU1 pipeline, 2D, streaming, sound, memory card - with addresses and how each fact was found |
| [docs/NATIVE_PORT_ROADMAP.md](docs/NATIVE_PORT_ROADMAP.md) | The plan to completion (milestones 1-8) and what "done" means |
| [docs/PROGRESS.md](docs/PROGRESS.md) | Status per area, open bugs, and the table of debug switches (`PS2X_*`, `VCS_*`) |
| [docs/DECISIONS.md](docs/DECISIONS.md) | Why things are the way they are; the user's decisions |
| [docs/PS2RECOMP_PATCHES.md](docs/PS2RECOMP_PATCHES.md) | Every change to the vendored PS2Recomp runtime, with the reason |
| [docs/NATIVE_RENDERER.md](docs/NATIVE_RENDERER.md) | The D3D11 renderer: layers, stages, HLE method |
| [docs/SETTINGS_MENU_WIDESCREEN.md](docs/SETTINGS_MENU_WIDESCREEN.md) | Settings registry / menu, Hor+ widescreen |
| [docs/FULLY_NATIVE.md](docs/FULLY_NATIVE.md) | The steps left until a normal frame is fully native, with their status - the working list |
| [docs/PERFORMANCE.md](docs/PERFORMANCE.md) | Frame rate well past 100 fps everywhere: how it is measured, what was done (numbers), what is next |
| [docs/RSL_SUBMISSION.md](docs/RSL_SUBMISSION.md) | Plan: render submission at the RSL level (milestone 7) - draws from the game's render calls instead of DMA packets |
| [docs/DISC.md](docs/DISC.md), [docs/CONTROLS.md](docs/CONTROLS.md) | Disc layout; keyboard / gamepad mapping |
| [docs/TRAINER.md](docs/TRAINER.md) | The trainer (F5): what it does, how (the game's script commands), its check |
| [docs/LINUX.md](docs/LINUX.md) | The Linux build: packages, flags, the Vulkan backend, what differs from Windows, the work list |
| [docs/LAUNCHER.md](docs/LAUNCHER.md) | The launcher and releases: what a release holds, the player's flow, the tools behind each button, the `@vcs` events, what was checked |

**When you learn something about the game, write it into docs/game-internals.md in the same change.**
Record addresses and how you found them. When something is weird, use judgment, fix or work around it,
and write it down (game-internals for the game, PS2RECOMP_PATCHES for the runtime, DECISIONS for
choices).

## What the project is

- GTA: Vice City Stories (PS2, SLUS-21590 USA) statically recompiled to C++ (PS2Recomp, vendored and
  heavily modified in `third_party/PS2Recomp`), turned step by step into a native port: native D3D11
  rendering of the game's models (`src/game/vcs_hle_world.cpp`), SDL3 platform layer, settings menu.
- Windows and Linux (docs/LINUX.md: clang, Vulkan; a plain host build). macOS later is possible (SDL3 + the RHI); the
  Steam Deck is postponed.
- Distribution is source-only, bring your own disc. **Never commit game code or data**: no ISO, no
  ELF, no generated C++ (`generated/`), no disassembly listings, no extracted assets. Analysis dumps go
  to `build/analysis/` (ignored). Function maps (names + addresses) and docs describing behaviour are
  fine.
- Authentic by default; every enhancement is an option (settings registry, `src/settings`).

## Layout

| Path | What |
|---|---|
| `src/main.cpp` | Launcher: ISO, settings registration, runtime start |
| `src/game/` | Game-specific code: overrides / hooks (`vcs_overrides.cpp`), native draw HLE (`vcs_hle_world.cpp`), display (`vcs_display.cpp`), the trainer (`vcs_trainer.cpp`), frame timing (`vcs_framerate.cpp`, per-frame mission meters `vcs_script_timing.cpp`), the player's controls (`vcs_input.cpp`; free aim `vcs_aim.cpp`), the game's music / effects levels as settings (`vcs_volume.cpp`) |
| `src/render/`, `src/rhi/`, `src/platform/` | Presenter + shaders (HLSL; DXBC by fxc, SPIR-V by `tools/hlsl_spirv.py`), the RHI (backends `d3d11/`, `vulkan/`, `null/`; only they see a graphics API), SDL3 platform layer |
| `src/sound/` | Sony's libsd on the host (the native sound driver in `src/game/vcs_sound.cpp` drives the SPU2 through it) |
| `src/settings/`, `src/ui/` | Settings registry + vcs.ini, the in-game settings menu (F2), the trainer menu (F5) |
| `src/debug/` | Crash handler, watchdog, sampling profiler, self-test, memory watch, the F3 game-state panel (`game_info.cpp`, also `gamectl.py gameinfo`) |
| `third_party/PS2Recomp/ps2xRuntime` | The runtime (EE, VIF, VU1, GS HW backend, IOP host, stubs); our changes marked `[gta-recomp]` |
| `game/vcs/` | Recompiler config, function map, VU1 upload list |
| `tools/` | Python 3 tools (standard library only) - see below |
| `launcher/` | `VCSLauncher.exe` (SDL3 + Dear ImGui, a CMake project of its own): disc, build tools, build, play - a front end over `tools/` (docs/LAUNCHER.md) |

```

The rig (`src/debug/rig.cpp`, `tools/rig.py`) drives the game through its own script VM: `Game.teleport`,
`set_time`, `weather`, `invincible`, `mission(n)` and raw `scm(bytes)` (assembler: `rig.Scm`, VCS opcode numbers
from the Sanny Builder Library, checked against the handler table - game-internals.md 11). `build/rig/saves/` holds
card copies to start from (never the user's live card).

- Test runs are **hidden** (the user's choice, 2026-10-24): no window, physical input ignored, sound on (the user
  mutes the game in Windows); all launches go through `toolchain.test_window`; the rig passes `run.py --hidden`.
  `VCS_TEST_VISIBLE=1` shows the window when asked. `run.py` on its own shows the window: the user starts the game
  with it too.
- `VCS_DATA_DIR=<dir>` gives a run its own memory card / cache. **Never run tests against the user's
  card** (`%LOCALAPPDATA%/VCSRecomp/mc0`) when they could write to it; copy it with
  `robocopy /E /COPY:DAT /DCOPY:T` (keeps creation times, which the card order depends on).
- `vcs.ini` next to `vcs.exe` holds the user's settings; environment overrides (`VCS_ASPECT=169`)
  apply to one run without touching it.
- Rebuild costs: a change to `ps2_memory.h`, `gs_backend.h`, `ps2_hle_survey.h` or anything the
  generated code includes rebuilds everything (~6-10 min); runtime-only changes ~1 min; `src/` only
  seconds. Prefer `src/game/vcs_overrides.cpp` for experiments.
- Test output (screenshots, logs, card copies) goes under `build/<tool>/<name>`; it adds up (23 GB by 2026-10-23,
  mostly screenshots). Run `python tools/clean.py --apply --keep-days 7` after a session of test runs. A capture
  worth keeping as a reference goes to `build/scenes/reference` (scenes compare) or `build/regress/baseline`.
- Optimisation (`--opt`): a fresh build directory is `lto` (ThinLTO: what players get from the README). `--quick`
  (= `none`) for day-to-day work (fast relinks); the choice stays in the CMake cache, and the last line of a build says
  which one it is. `pgo` / `lto` relink slower and are for measuring and releases. A PGO profile from older code still
  builds; retrain (`--opt pgo --train`, ~30 min) after large changes. Never edit sources while a build or the PGO
  pipeline is compiling them.
- A successful build writes `iso=<disc>` into the `vcs.ini` next to `vcs.exe` when that file has none, so the exe
  started on its own finds the disc.
- The launcher (`launcher/`, docs/LAUNCHER.md) only runs `tools/`: build logic stays in Python, so a change to the
  pipeline is a change to the scripts. The tools print `@vcs {json}` event lines (`toolchain.event` / `stage` / `fail`
  with a code) the launcher reads; keep them when changing a tool's output. `VCSLauncher.exe --screenshot F.png
  [--step N | --demo error | --action build]` renders its window hidden (tests, docs); `--self-test` is CI's check.

## Rules that keep things working

1. **Reference first.** A native replacement of an emulated path is checked against it (bit-exact
   where possible: `PS2X_HLE_VERIFY=1`; picture diff via scenes otherwise) and keeps a switch back
   (`PS2X_HLE=0`-style). The emulated path is never deleted.
2. **Hooks on recompiled functions** (DECISIONS.md): a generated function may return to the EE
   scheduler mid-body and be resumed through the function table, bypassing a wrapper. A hook may work
   *before* calling the original or replace it entirely; never rely on code after the original
   returns. Never call a guest function directly from host code expecting it to run to the end -
   chain it as a guest tail call (see `VCS_TEST_SAVE`).
3. **Floating point**: no FP contraction in generated / VU code; VU maths rounds toward zero
   (`FE_TOWARDZERO` where reproducing it). Bit-exactness depends on both.
4. **Never run `PS2X_GS=gpu`** (paraLLEl-GS) on the dev machine: it hangs the GTX 1080 Ti into a TDR
   reset and blanks the user's screen. `hw` (D3D11) is vcs.exe's own default.
5. **Patch scripts**: shell heredocs on this machine turn `\n` inside Python strings into real
   newlines and corrupt C++ string literals. Use the Edit tool, or write the script to a file first.
6. **Scripts are Python 3, standard library only**, runnable from any shell; extend `tools/*.py`
   (shared helpers in `tools/toolchain.py`) instead of adding shell scripts.
7. **Runtime changes** in `third_party/PS2Recomp` get a `[gta-recomp]` marker and a row in
   PS2RECOMP_PATCHES.md.
8. **Commit** at every milestone / major change, with a message that says why. End commit messages
   with the attribution line the environment asks for.

## Recognising old problems

- Wrong colours on every texture: data shifted by VIFcodes (VIF1 DIRECT continuation, fixed).
- Stuck on a loading screen, no crash: an IOP-side wait (`VCS_TRACE_DELAY`, `PS2X_TRACE_SPU`).
- Thread "returns" to a float bit pattern (`0x3F333333`...): a saved `$ra` overwritten - the
  checkpoint-unwind class of bug (`VCS_WATCH=lo,hi,...`).
- Saves written but never found: card directory order (game-internals.md 10c).
- A mission stuck after a ped should talk, or peds vanishing: check the mission audio slots and who deletes the ped
  (`VCS_TRACE_PED_REMOVE`, game-internals.md 12); Shakedown's was the recompiler's 32-bit compare-with-zero branches.
- Something wrong only above 100 fps: a `ms_fTimeStep < 0.5` branch the PS2 never takes (game-internals.md 4).
- A mission bar / meter / timer faster at high frame rates: the mission script adds a fixed amount every frame; add
  the instruction to `src/game/vcs_script_timing.cpp` (game-internals.md 11f has the survey and how to read a mission).
- Load Game stuck on "Loading..." then a return to text (`0x4548435F`) from the script VM: host code took a game
  script for one of its own (a remembered script slot the load had refilled; game-internals.md 11d, `[rig] script
  slot` in the log).
- "Loading..." over black after a mission's last cutscene, the game running behind it (clock and scripts move): the
  screen left faded out for a script that never comes - Last Stand out of story order waits for the credits
  (game-internals.md 11g). F12's draw log shows the black quad and the text; the active scripts show who is missing.
- `ninja: error: manifest 'build.ninja' still dirty after 100 tries`: files dated after the clock (a zip from another
  time zone); `build.py` sets them to now (`toolchain.fix_future_files`, docs/LAUNCHER.md).
- A tool fails within a second, its log empty (a player's report, 2026-10-31): a crash before the first line - the log
  now ends with the exit code (`0xC000001D` illegal instruction: a build for a newer CPU, `PS2X_CPU`; DECISIONS.md).
- First things to grep in a log: `[ee] thread N -> dormant`, `[guest-branch:unlisted-resume]`.

## Working style for long autonomous runs

- Follow docs/NATIVE_PORT_ROADMAP.md milestone by milestone without pausing for routine decisions;
  record decisions in DECISIONS.md and progress / numbers in PROGRESS.md.
- Measure before and after anything on the hot path (perf lines from `gamectl.py perf`, scenes'
  `perf_*.txt`); keep the numbers in the docs.
- Keep the regression rig (milestone 1) green; add a check when you fix a bug so it stays fixed.
