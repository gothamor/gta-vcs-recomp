# T2 Population, Distant Life & Distant Lights — Action Plan & Agent Guide

> **Authoritative Architecture & Rules for Task T2 (`src/game/vcs_distance.*`, `src/game/vcs_distant.*`, `src/game/vcs_hle_world.cpp`)**
>
> This document defines the mandatory behavior, distance bands, invariants, root causes of historical regressions, and implementation plan for real population vs. decorative distant life (`Distant traffic`, `Distant crowds`, and `Distant lights`/coronas).
> **Every future agent touching population, draw distance, or distant proxies MUST follow these rules without exception.**

---

## 1. Golden Architectural Rules (Mandatory for All Agents)

1. **Never Shrink or Replace Real Population When Decorative Settings Are Enabled**
   - Enabling `Distant crowds` (`world.distant_crowds`) or `Distant traffic` (`world.distant_traffic`) **MUST NEVER** clamp, override, or reduce `pedDistance()` or `carDistance()` in `src/game/vcs_distance.cpp`.
   -Decorative systems exist **strictly to extend life beyond the simulated population horizon** — never to substitute real AI peds or real vehicles near the player.

2. **Two Non-Overlapping Distance Zones**
   - **Zone 1 — Real Simulated Population (`0 m` to `~300–400 m` at max slider)**:
     - Controlled by `src/game/vcs_distance.cpp` (`world.population_distance`, `world.ped_density`, `world.traffic_density`).
     - Real pedestrians and real vehicles with full PS2 AI, physics, collision, animations, and headlights/taillights cover the close and medium range around the player (up to **~300–400 m** when `Population distance` is raised).
     - Visibility culling in `FUN_0036EBF8` (`visibilityInit`, `0x004CD5D8` / `0x004CD5CC` for peds and `0x004CD5C4` / `0x004CD5B8` for vehicles) must scale with `pedDistance()` and `carDistance()` so real peds and cars are never culled inside their live simulation radius.
   - **Zone 2 — Decorative Distant Life (`>= 300–400 m` outward, strictly beyond Zone 1)**:
     - Controlled by `src/game/vcs_distant.cpp` (`world.distant_traffic`, `world.distant_crowds`).
     - Decorative proxy cars and decorative walkers may **ONLY** spawn and exist in the far band (`[lo, hi]`) where:
       - `carLo = max(kMinDistantCarNear, realCarOuterRadius + kBandMargin)` (at least `320–350 m`, and always strictly past the real vehicle removal radius).
       - `pedLo = max(kMinDistantPedNear, realPedOuterRadius + kBandMargin)` (at least `300–350 m`, and always strictly past the real pedestrian removal radius).
     - Any decorative proxy car or walker whose distance to the camera drops below `lo` (`d < lo`) must be **immediately culled and recycled** (no `0.9 * lo` hysteresis encroaching into the real zone).

3. **Never Read Transient Guest Globals Across Subsystem Phases**
   - In `CGame::Process` (`0x003BA8D8`), `CPopulation::Update` (`0x002AFE80`) runs *before* `CWorld::Process` (`0x001933C0`), while `CCarCtrl::GenerateRandomCars` (`0x00430148`) runs *after* `CWorld::Process`.
   - Therefore, during `CWorld::Process` (`vcs::distant::worldProcess`), the guest float `0x006F4CA0` (`GenerationDistMultiplier`) holds the **pedestrian** value written by `CPopulation::Update`, **not** the vehicle value!
   - `vcs::distant` **MUST NEVER** read `0x006F4CA0` directly from guest RAM to infer real traffic or crowd radii. Always query explicit C++ helpers in `vcs::distance` (`vcs::distance::realCarOuterRadius()`, `vcs::distance::realPedOuterRadius()`).

4. **Off-Screen Template Entities Must Never Leak Near-Player Draws**
   - When `addTemplates` appends an off-screen real vehicle or ped to `kVehicleList` (`0x00744AC0`) so its meshes can be piggybacked for distant proxies, the template entity itself is off-screen (`all != 0` in clip test) and must be skipped while only its distant proxies (`>= 300 m`) are drawn.
   - Candidate template search radius (`kTemplateRange`, `kPedTemplateRange`) must cover the full real population radius (`~400 m`) so templates are always found even when real cars and peds are spread across `0–400 m`.

---

## 2. Root Causes of the T2 Bugs Diagnosed on 2026-11-05

### Bug 1: `Distant crowds` Replaced Real Peds Near the Player (54–60 m)
- **Cause 1A (`src/game/vcs_distance.cpp`)**:
  `pedDistance()` was implemented as:
  ```cpp
  float pedDistance() { return vcs::distant::crowdsOn() ? 1.0f : std::min(percent(g_population), kMaxPedDistance); }
  ```
  Turning on `Distant crowds` forced `pedDistance()` to `1.0f` (PS2 default: 35–65 m), ignoring the user's `Population distance` slider.
- **Cause 1B (`src/game/vcs_distant.cpp`)**:
  `kCrowdNear` was hardcoded to `60.0f` meters, and `move()` kept decorative walkers down to `lo * 0.9f = 54.0f` meters. Because decorative walkers clone the posed mesh of 1–4 template peds and slide along pavement links without collision or AI, having them at 54 m right in front of the player looked broken and replaced real pedestrians.
- **Cause 1C (`src/game/vcs_distance.cpp` & guest `FUN_00268048` / `FUN_002B17A8`)**:
  - `kMaxPedDistance` was capped at `2.0f` (~120 m) instead of scaling out to ~300–350 m.
  - In `FUN_00268048` (`CPopulation::AddToPopulation` spot finder), `FUN_00269228` (`kNodeList`) is called at return address `0x0026812Cu` with `$f12 = 160.0f` centered on the player and a 240-node cap (`$a3 = 240`). When `pedDistance()` scales up to ~300–350 m, `nodeList` in `vcs_distance.cpp` must also scale the ped node search radius `$f12` and bias the search center forward along the camera view (just as it does for cars at `kSpotFinder`), and `FUN_002B17A8` (`addpop.c`) must scale its fallback `35.0f`/`60.0f` band so real peds spawn and stay alive out to ~300–350 m.

### Bug 2: `Distant traffic` Spawned Decorative Cars at 153–170 m
- **Cause 2A (`src/game/vcs_distant.cpp`)**:
  `band()` read `rdf(kGenMultiplier)` (`0x006F4CA0`) inside `worldProcess` (`CWorld::Process`). Because `CPopulation::Update` had just overwritten `0x006F4CA0` with `g_genBase * pedDistance()` (which was `1.0f`), `band()` computed `lo = 170.0f * 1.0f = 170.0f` (and `move()` kept proxy cars down to `0.9f * 170.0f = 153.0f` m) even when real traffic was configured to reach 400+ m.
- **Cause 2B (`src/game/vcs_distant.cpp`)**:
  When `Population distance` was at 100%, `170.0f * gen` allowed proxy cars at 153–170 m instead of enforcing a minimum distant floor (`>= 320–350 m`).

### Bug 3: Distant Lights & Coronas Were Broken / Missing
- **Cause 3A — Misplaced Code in `drawLitProxies` (`src/game/vcs_hle_world.cpp`)**:
  The distant vehicle headlight/taillight quad generator (`if (px.night && px.lights.count > 0 ...)`) was placed inside `drawLitProxies` (used exclusively by `drawNativeLit`, table `0x04` — **skinned pedestrians**, where `px.lights.count` is always `0`!) instead of `drawProxies` (used by `drawNativeRigid`, table `0x10`/`0x13` — **rigid vehicles**). As a result, distant vehicle light quads never rendered.
- **Cause 3B — Wrong Transform Matrix & Dark Lighting on Light Quads (`src/game/vcs_hle_world.cpp`)**:
  - The light quad builder wrote world-space positions (`worldPos`) into `GSNativeDraw::VcsLit` vertices while reusing `d.constants` from the template mesh (`m` and `cm` = `templateObjectToScreen` / `templateObjectToClip`). Because `d.constants` includes the template car's local part matrix `a` (which for an off-screen template car is translated to `(0, 0, -2000)`), transforming world-space vertices by `d.constants` sent the quads miles off-screen or to random positions near the player.
  - Furthermore, `VcsLit` shades vertices using `L.dir * L.col + L.ambient`. With zero normals `(0, 0, 0)` and night-time `L.ambient` (~0.15), light quads were dimmed by 85% and fogged out instead of rendering as unlit emissive sprites (`ambient = {1, 1, 1, 1}`, directional colors = `0`, fog = `0`).
  - `g_lastLightTemplate` was a static atomic never reset per entity (`beginEntity`) or per frame (`frameKicked`), so if only one template model was active, its lights were skipped on every subsequent frame.
- **Cause 3C — Distant World / Street-Lamp Coronas (`CCoronas` 56-Slot PS2 Limit)**:
  - In VCS PS2 (`FUN_0027C418` / `FUN_0027DD80`), `CCoronas::aCoronas` at `0x00512560` has only **56 slots** (`0x38`, stride `0x90`), and `CEntity::ProcessLightsForEntity` (`FUN_0027E430`) culls 2DFX coronas beyond each effect's PS2 `coronaShowDist` (`offset +0x18`, typically `100–150 m`).
  - Injecting distant coronas into `CCoronas::aCoronas` would immediately overflow the 56-slot table and starve nearby car headlights and traffic lights.
  - Therefore, distant light coronas (both distant vehicle headlights/taillights and distant 2DFX street/building lights beyond the real corona range) must be rendered natively in the HLE pass without consuming slots in `0x00512560`.

## 3. Target Distance Specification

| Layer | Controlled By | Inner Radius (`lo`) | Outer Radius (`hi`) | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Real Pedestrians** | `vcs_distance.cpp` | `0 m` | `~65 m` (at 100%) up to **`~325 m`** (at 300% slider, `5.0x` multiplier) | Full PS2 AI, physics, collision, bones. Never reduced by `Distant crowds`. |
| **Real Vehicles** | `vcs_distance.cpp` | `0 m` | `~160 m` (at 100%) up to **`~400 m`** (at 300% slider, `2.5x` multiplier) | Full PS2 pathing, physics, headlights/taillights. Never reduced by `Distant traffic`. |
| **Decorative Crowds (`Distant crowds`)** | `vcs_distant.cpp` | `max(320 m, realPedOuter + 20 m)` | `lo + 3.0f * setting` (up to `~620–650 m` at 100) | Posed walker proxies on pavement links strictly beyond real peds. |
| **Decorative Traffic (`Distant traffic`)** | `vcs_distant.cpp` | `max(350 m, realCarOuter + 20 m)` | `lo + 5.5f * setting` (up to `~900–970 m` at 100) | Rigid vehicle proxies on car path links strictly beyond real cars. |
| **Distant Lights / Coronas** | `vcs_distant.cpp` + `vcs_hle_world.cpp` | `lo` of distant traffic (for car lights) / `150 m` (for world 2DFX lights) | `hi` of distant traffic / `~900 m` | Emissive camera-facing billboards at night (19:00–06:00). |

## 4. Step-by-Step Implementation Plan

### Step 1: Fix Real Population Distance & Ped Spawning (`src/game/vcs_distance.h` & `src/game/vcs_distance.cpp`)
1. **Decouple `pedDistance()` from `vcs::distant::crowdsOn()`**:
   - Remove the `vcs::distant::crowdsOn() ? 1.0f : ...` override in `pedDistance()`.
   - Map `g_population` (`100..300%`) so:
     - At `100%` (PS2 default): `carDistance() = 1.0f` (~160 m), `pedDistance() = 1.0f` (~65 m).
     - At `300%` (slider 100 in UI): `carDistance() = 2.5f` (**400 m** outer radius), `pedDistance() = 5.0f` (**325 m** outer radius).
2. **Scale Real Ped Visibility & Spawn/Keep Radii**:
   - In `visibilityInit` (`FUN_0036EBF8` hook):
     - Scale `kPedVisSq` (`0x004CD5D8`) and `kPedLodSq` (`0x004CD5CC`) by `(own * peds * 70.0f)^2` so real peds remain visible out to `350 m` at max slider.
     - Scale `kVehicleLodSq` (`0x004CD5C4`) and `kBigVehLodSq` (`0x004CD5B8`) so real vehicles remain visible out to `>400 m`.
   - In `nodeList` (`FUN_00269228` hook):
     - Handle both the car spot finder (`ra == 0x00267A4Cu`) and the ped spot finder (`ra == 0x0026812Cu` in `FUN_00268048`).
     - When `pedDistance() > 1.0f`, scale the ped node search radius `$f12` (`160.0f * pedDistance()`, capped to keep within the 240-node buffer or shifted forward along the camera view direction so pavement nodes out to 300–325 m are cached).
   - In `FUN_002B17A8` (`addpop.c` / `kAddToPop` hook):
     - Ensure `GenerationDistMultiplier` (`0x006F4CA0`) is applied consistently during `CPopulation::Update` (`0x002AFE80`) and that `FUN_00268048` receives the scaled generation/removal distances.
3. **Expose Deterministic Radius Queries in `vcs::distance`**:
   - Add `float realCarOuterRadius()` and `float realPedOuterRadius()` to `vcs::distance` so `vcs::distant` can query the exact real population outer radii on any thread/phase without reading transient guest RAM (`0x006F4CA0`).

### Step 2: Fix Decorative Traffic & Crowd Bands (`src/game/vcs_distant.h` & `src/game/vcs_distant.cpp`)
1. **Fix `band()` for Proxy Cars**:
   - Replace the broken `rdf(kGenMultiplier)` read with `vcs::distance::realCarOuterRadius()`.
   - Set `lo = std::max(350.0f, vcs::distance::realCarOuterRadius() + 20.0f)`.
   - Set `hi = lo + 5.5f * static_cast<float>(setting)`.
2. **Fix Crowd Band (`worldProcess` / `placeWalkers` / `move`)**:
   - Set `pedLo = std::max(320.0f, vcs::distance::realPedOuterRadius() + 20.0f)`.
   - Set `pedHi = pedLo + 3.0f * static_cast<float>(crowds)`.
3. **Strict Inner-Boundary Culling**:
   - In `move()`, immediately recycle any proxy car with `d < lo` or `d > hi * 1.05f` (and any walker with `d < pedLo` or `d > pedHi * 1.05f`). Never allow `0.9f * lo` to let decorative entities drift inside the real population zone.
   - Also reject any proxy car or walker behind the camera (`dot < -0.15f`) so slots are concentrated in the player's view frustum.
4. **Update Template Selection Ranges**:
   - Increase `kTemplateRange` (`160.0f -> 420.0f`) and `kPedTemplateRange` (`60.0f -> 350.0f`) so `addTemplates` can always find loaded real cars/peds to use as mesh templates even when real entities are spread out to 300–400 m.

### Step 3: Fix Distant Lights & World Coronas (`src/game/vcs_distant.cpp`)
1. **Fix `CRegisteredCorona` Table Stride (`kCoronaStride = 0x30u`)**:
   - Each `CRegisteredCorona` entry in `0x00512560` is `0x30` bytes (`48` bytes, 56 entries from `0x00512560` to `0x00512FE0`), as proven by `FUN_0027dd80` (`addiu $a0, $a0, 0x30`) and `FUN_0027c418` (`addiu $s2, $s2, 0x30`). Never use `0x90`.
2. **Hook `CCoronas::RegisterCorona` (`0x0027DD80`)**:
   - Guard with `if (ctx->pc == kRegisterCorona)` so mid-function checkpoint resumes pass straight through.
   - Suppress corona registrations from off-screen template vehicles added by `addTemplates(false)` (`g_addedCarTemplates`) so off-screen template cars never pollute the 56-slot `CCoronas::aCoronas` table (`0x00512560`).
   - Cull behind-camera and near-camera-plane coronas (`dot < 1.2 m` or `dist2 < 1.8 m^2` with camera forward `0x006F44E0`) and free any existing slot (`id` at `+0x20`, `fadeState` at `+0x24`, `registeredAlpha` at `+0x25`) so raising `View distance` does not fill all 56 corona slots with behind-camera streetlamps.
   - Cap base world-space `size` (`std::abs(ctx->f[12])`) to `0.65 m` for vehicle lights and `0.90 m` for world/2DFX lights, and clamp `normalAngle` (`ctx->f[14]`) to `>= 0.85 rad` so `CCoronas::Render` Branch 1 (`6.0 * (1 - normalAngle * 2/pi)^8 + 0.5`) never multiplies corona radius by `6.5x`.
   - Scale vehicle corona `farClip` (`$f13 <= 55.0 m`) with `realCarOuterRadius() / 160.0f` (up to `250 m`) and building/streetlamp 2DFX corona `farClip` (`55 < $f13 <= 200 m`) with `ms_lodDistScale` (`0x004887F8`, up to `300 m`).
   - When all 56 slots are occupied, evict the farthest / behind-camera non-sun/moon (`slotId > 2`) slot in favor of closer lights and vehicle headlights/taillights.
3. **Hook `CCoronas::Render` (`0x0027C418`) to Eliminate Close-Range / Widescreen Edge Perspective Explosion**:
   - `CSprite::CalcScreenCoors` (`0x0039FC48`) divides a corona's world-space `size` by camera-space depth `z_cam` (`dot`), not Euclidean distance `dist`. In widescreen 16:9, when the player drives or walks past a streetlamp or car on the left/right side of the road, `z_cam` approaches `0` while `dist` is still `5–15 m`, causing `1 / z_cam` to explode by `15x–50x`.
   - Before calling `FUN_0027c418`, temporarily scale each active non-sun/moon slot's `size` (`+0x00`) by `dot / std::max(dist, 22.0f)` and damp `fadeState` (`+0x24`) when `dot < 6.0 m` or `dist < 16.0 m`, then restore both after `FUN_0027c418` returns. The `dot` factor cancels `1 / z_cam`, making screen radius proportional to `baseSize / std::max(dist, 22.0f)`.

### Step 4: Multithreaded World Chunk & Model Streaming (`src/game/vcs_stream.cpp` & `src/game/vcs_distance.cpp`)
1. **Unblock `CRenderer::ScanSectorList` (`0x0035FAE8`) & Expand `ShouldModelBeStreamed` (`0x0035F910`)**:
   - `CRenderer::ScanSectorList_Priority` (`0x0035FED0`) sets `ms_bStreamingLocked` (`0x004CD5AC`) to `1` on the very first unloaded model in the immediate camera sector, which caused `CRenderer::ScanSectorList` (`0x0035FAE8` at `0x35fe10`) to skip `RequestModel` for all unloaded trees, sidewalks, streetlamps, and props in all other visible sectors.
   - Hook `0x0035FAE8` (`scanSectorList`) to clear `0x004CD5AC = 0` when the stream manager queue (`*(0x490158) + 0xE20`) has `< 32` entries, and hook `0x0035F910` (`shouldModelBeStreamed`) to apply `std::max(ms_lodDistScale, LODDistMultiplier) * 1.35f` so separate world props are prefetched well ahead of their draw distance.
2. **Multithreaded Worker Pool & Parallel Queue Prefetch (`src/game/vcs_stream.cpp`)**:
   - Spawn `4–8` worker threads (`std::clamp(hardware_concurrency(), 4u, 8u)`) reading concurrently from the lock-free memory-mapped ISO (`IsoImage::readBytes`).
   - Hook `FUN_002213d0` (`0x002213D0`, `streamEnqueue`) so every callback-less `CStreaming` request (`callback == 0`) queued behind `mgr->activeReq` (`+0xE24`) immediately dispatches its `(dest, lsn, bytes)` read to the worker thread pool in parallel while `CRenderer::ScanWorld` is still scanning sectors.
   - Hook `FUN_00220fa8` (`0x00220FA8`, `streamPump`) to drain all prefetched/ready callback-less requests in `mgr + 0xE24` and `mgr + 0xE18` in a single batch when called outside `streamEnqueue`, eliminating the 1-request-per-call DFF/TXD dependency stall.
   - Hook `CStreaming::ProcessLoadingChannel` (`0x003C7048`) to convert up to `6` ready resources (TXDs and DFFs) per frame within a strict `1.2 ms` time budget instead of stopping after a single resource per frame.
   - Reduce `streamPoll` (`0x002218F0`) wait from `20 ms` to `250 us` on channel 4 (`CWorldStream` chunk streaming) and `2 ms` on other channels, and add a lock-free fast path to `overlay()` when no mod overlays are active.

## 5. Verification Checklist for Agents

Before considering any T2 change complete, agents **must** verify via the hidden test rig (`tools/distance_check.py` and `toolchain.test_window --hidden` with isolated `VCS_DATA_DIR`):

1. **`distancestate` & Pool Check**:
   - With `world.population_distance = 100` (`300%`), `world.distant_crowds = 100`, `world.distant_traffic = 100`:
   - `pedDistance()` (`peddist`) is `5.00` (~325 m survival / ~350 m visibility), **not** collapsed to `1.0f`.
   - Real peds (`maxpedd`) and real cars (`maxcard`) populate `0–350+ m`.
2. **`proxies` Distance Band Check**:
   - Query the `proxies` control command and verify that **every** active proxy car has `mincar >= 340 m` (`>= 495 m` at slider 100) and **every** active decorative walker has `minped >= 310 m` (`>= 340 m` at slider 100). Zero decorative entities may exist within `0–310 m` of the player.
3. **Night Distant Lights Check (`coronas`)**:
   - At night (`set_time(22)`, `view_distance = 50`), query `coronas` and verify `active <= 56`, `veh > 0` (vehicle headlights/taillights are not starved by streetlamps), `tmplskip > 0` (off-screen template car coronas suppressed), `behindskip > 0`, and `evicted > 0`.
4. **Performance & Stability**:
   - No NaN cascades, no pool overflows (`overflow=0` or bounded in `EntryInfoNode` reserve), `stale=0` in `proxies`, and `tools/distance_check.py` passes.

---

## 6. Implemented & Verified Baseline (2026-11-05)

All three steps above are implemented and verified in `src/game/vcs_distance.h`, `src/game/vcs_distance.cpp`, and `src/game/vcs_distant.cpp`:
- `distancestate` (Ocean Drive / Washington Beach boulevard, `population_distance=100`, `vehicle_density=50`, `pedestrian_density=50`):
  - `Distant crowds = 0`, `Distant traffic = 0`: `peddist=5.00`, `maxcard=355 m`, `maxpedd=356 m`
  - `Distant crowds = 100`, `Distant traffic = 100`: `peddist=5.00`, `maxcard=350..371 m`, `maxpedd=351..371 m`
- `proxies` (`Distant crowds = 100`, `Distant traffic = 100`):
  - `count=200`, `walkers=299..300`, `carband=495..1045 m`, `pedband=340..640 m`, `mincar=496..500 m`, `minped=341..343 m`, `stale=0`
- `coronas` (Night 22:00, `view_distance=50`):
  - `active=56`, `veh=27`, `maxdist=249..262 m`, `tmplskip=397..488`, `behindskip=296k+`, `evicted=644..732`
- `tools/distance_check.py`: `PASS` (`original 100% -> view28 352% -> back 100%`).

---

## 7. Critical Learnings & Anti-Patterns (Post-Mortem: 2026-11-05)

### Anti-Pattern 1: Wrapping Recompiled Functions with Guest Branches (`dispatchGuestBranch`) in C++ Loops
- **Failure Mode**: Attempting to hook `FUN_003c7048` (`kProcessLoadingChannel`) or `FUN_00220fa8` (`kStreamPump`) with a C++ `for (int pass = 1; pass < 6; ++pass)` loop.
- **Root Cause**: Recompiled functions in PS2Recomp are **not** ordinary C++ functions. When a guest instruction invokes `runtime->dispatchGuestBranch` (e.g. `JAL`), the function returns immediately (`return;`) to the outer guest scheduler. Calling it in a C++ loop decrements `$sp` multiple times, corrupts stack frames and `$ra`, and triggers `[guest-branch:missing-target] ... target=0x1fdabb0` which terminates the game thread (`[ee] thread 1 -> dormant`).
- **Rule**: Never wrap any recompiled function that contains internal guest branch dispatches in a synchronous C++ loop.

### Anti-Pattern 2: Multithreading Sequential Channel Streaming without Protocol Synchronization
- **Failure Mode**: Spawning multiple worker threads that pop concurrently from the CDVD read queue across channels 0–5.
- **Root Cause**: The PS2 streaming protocol relies on strictly ordered sequential delivery per channel. When multiple threads process requests concurrently on the same channel, later requests finish ahead of earlier ones. `streamPoll` returns ready prematurely, causing the game engine to parse half-written textures and models from guest RAM, corrupting memory and crashing during loading.

### Anti-Pattern 3: Wrapping `CCoronas::Render` (`0x0027C418`) vs. Adjusting `CCoronas::RegisterCorona` (`0x0027DD80`)
- **Failure Mode**: Attempting to intercept `CCoronas::Render` to temporarily scale corona slot radii.
- **Root Cause**: `FUN_0027c418` has over 30 guest branch dispatch resume points. Any cleanup code placed after `g_coronasRender()` runs prematurely on the very first yield.
- **Solution**: Handle corona size capping and near-camera dampening entirely inside `CCoronas::RegisterCorona` (`0x0027DD80`). By modulating `$f12` (radius) and `$t0` (alpha) with a smooth proximity factor:
  ```cpp
  const float fade = std::clamp((dot - 1.5f) / 7.5f, 0.0f, 1.0f) *
                     std::clamp((dist - 2.0f) / 18.0f, 0.0f, 1.0f);
  ctx->f[12] = std::copysign(clampedBaseSize * std::max(0.04f, fade), ctx->f[12]);
  SET_GPR_U32(ctx, 8, static_cast<uint32_t>(origAlpha * fade));
  ```
  The near-camera perspective singularity (`1 / dot` approaching infinity) is algebraically cancelled out, preventing coronas from blowing up across the screen when passing streetlamps or cars.


### Anti-Pattern 4: Testing Model-View Matrix (.v[3]) instead of MVP Matrix (.v[3]) for Proxy Distance & Frustum Culling
- **Failure Mode**: In drawProxies and drawLitProxies (src/game/vcs_hle_world.cpp), size culling tested size < 0.008f * transform(cm, centre).v[3] and frustum culling tested clipFlags(q, q.v[3]) using cm (VU row 24).
- **Root Cause**: setupMatrices(tmp, 0, 16, 12, 24) outputs Model-View to rows 24-27 and MVP (Model-View-Projection) to rows 28-31. In an affine Model-View matrix, v[3] is always 1.0f. Testing transform(cm, centre).v[3] resulted in size < 0.008f * 1.0f = 8 mm, meaning no part of any car or pedestrian was ever culled, causing all 240 distant cars to submit ~20 individual draw calls (wheels, doors, headlights, wipers) even at 800 meters, flooding the worker thread with 7,906 draws per frame and collapsing framerates to 30 FPS. Furthermore, clipFlags against q.v[3] == 1.0f on eye-space coordinates completely broke bounding-box frustum culling.
- **Solution**: Fold MVP row 28 (m) first. In row 28, pc.v[3] is true camera depth z_cam. Sub-meshes smaller than threshold are culled before matrix setup, and transform(m, v) produces true clip-space coordinates for exact frustum culling. Row 24 (cm) is folded only for visible surviving meshes. This reduced drive draw calls from 7,906 down to 2,494 (-68.5%) and restored 57-60 FPS driving performance.

### Anti-Pattern 5: PS2 DVD-Head Streaming Lock (ms_bStreamingLocked = 0x004CD5AC) Stalling World Props
- **Failure Mode**: When driving fast through sectors, trees, sidewalks, and street props popped in right in front of the vehicle.
- **Root Cause**: CRenderer::ScanSectorList_Priority (0x0035FED0) sets ms_bStreamingLocked = 1 on the first missing model in the camera sector. This flag remained set for the entire rest of CRenderer::ScanWorld, causing ScanSectorList (0x0035FAE8) to skip RequestModel for every other visible sector.
- **Solution**: Hooked ScanSectorList (0x0035FAE8) to clear ms_bStreamingLocked = 0 when world.view_distance is active, allowing models across visible sectors to prefetch asynchronously ahead of the player. Additionally reduced streamPoll (0x002218F0) wait from 20 ms to 250 us on channel 4 and replaced byte-by-byte copies in overlay() with std::memcpy.
