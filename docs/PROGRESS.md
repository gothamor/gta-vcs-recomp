# Progress

## 2026-10-31 - Native startup and pause actions

- A host title menu appears after the intro movies, before the game starts: New Game, Load Game, Delete Game, Options
  (the F2 pages), and confirmed Quit. The original game owns save enumeration, loading and deletion.
- It opens after the boot loading splash has finished and renders labels from the game's proportional font atlas when
  the configured texture pack supplies it; background and font each retain a built-in fallback.
- The user pause menu has a Port Menu panel for Options and confirmed Quit; it can be dismissed back to every original
  VCS tab. See `docs/FRONTEND_MENU.md`.

## 2026-10-31 - Optional PCSX2 PNG texture packs

- F2 > Graphics > Texture replacements (restart; off by default), existing `SLUS-21590/replacements` found beside
  the exe or in the source root. Configurable path, async PNG decoding, shared GPU images, byte-budgeted LRU,
  original fallback and high-resolution sampling with the game's wrap/region/alpha rules. `docs/TEXTURE_PACKS.md`.
- Checked: build; loader tests (legacy names, palettes, non-integer PNG sizes, unchanged alpha, asynchronous
  dedup/reload and corrupt-file fallback); all 160 user PNGs decoded; five actual gameplay locations, 25 pack files
  matched/loaded; disabled static captures mean difference 0.051 / 0.128 (loading / pause map, tolerance 2.0).
- Cache-pressure check found empty alternate VBlanks evicting active textures; protect two previous frames too.
  The targeted 64 MiB / bilinear check passes without repeated per-VBlank reloads. Native render targets unchanged.
- Same-build off/on benchmark: all six spots held 60 fps; AI drive game 5.50 -> 5.58 ms, worker 3.32 -> 3.32 ms,
  GS 2.95 -> 2.97 ms. One capped pair; full numbers and conditions in PERFORMANCE.md 21.
- Fixed the rig's empty-card readiness: area 0 plus advancing frames also described the title flyover. It now
  requires a player ped; earlier empty-card bench results from that check should not be treated as gameplay.

## Phase 0 - setup (done)
- Repo, GPL-3.0, `.gitignore` blocking game files; `tools/vcs_disc.py`
- PS2Recomp vendored (changes in `docs/PS2RECOMP_PATCHES.md`)
- Toolchain: clang-cl 23 + MSVC 14.29 STL, CMake, Ninja, Ghidra 12.1.4 + EE ext, JDK 21

## Phase 1 - analysis (done)
- 9,550 Ghidra functions + 833 indirectly-referenced ones Ghidra missed
  (`tools/find_missing_functions.py`), SDK identification, `game/vcs/vcs.toml`

## Phase 2 - boot (done)
- ISO mapped as cdrom0: (EE, VFS, IOP), real IRX modules on the emulated IOP
- Fixed: interrupt stacks clobbering the main stack, ';1' names for the
  game's file table, cdvdman imports for CDSTREAM, many SDK stubs
- Game loop runs; title/intro 3D scene renders (CPU renderer)
- Movies skipped for now (`src/game/vcs_overrides.cpp`)

## Phase 3 - graphics / performance (in progress)
- [x] VU1: hctp's throughput-mode VU1 core (13 -> 23 VBlanks/s, GS discarded)
- [x] IOP time batching (23 -> 60 VBlanks/s, GS discarded) = full speed without GS
- [x] paraLLEl-GS integrated but opt-in: hangs Pascal GPUs into TDR resets
- [x] GS usage survey (`VCS_GS_STATS`): see docs/game-internals.md
- [~] Hardware GS backend (`PS2X_GS=hw`, `src/lib/gs/gs_hw.cpp`; D3D11 since stage 3 of NATIVE_RENDERER.md, was OpenGL): runs at
      full speed and shows the loading screen. Fixed: overlapping render targets
      (back buffer FBP 140 = FBP 0 + 448 lines), stale page cache for CLUT loads.
- [x] Loading screens had wrong colours: VIF1 fed the next DMAtag's VIFcodes to
      the GIF as image data (8-byte shift of every texture/CLUT). Fixed.
- [x] ~25 s bad-pointer crash: gone after the IOP heap fix (CDSTREAM's 256 KB
      streaming buffer failed to allocate; the game ran an error path).
- [x] Stuck on the loading screen: IOP `sprintf` didn't format, so the sound
      bank file was never found. Fixed; the game now reaches the first in-game
      scene (Fort Baxter: Vic + army truck).
- [x] Crash in the first scene (returns to 0x3F333333-style addresses): runtime
      treated a preempted recursive call as returned (stack off by inner frames).
      Fixed; the game now plays the opening cutscene (Vic, Sgt. Martinez).
- [x] Props near-invisible: VIF UNPACK V4-5 didn't expand RGBA5551. Fixed.
- [x] Tilted horizon / broken camera maths: SQRT.S read the wrong register field
      (every sqrtf). Fixed: horizon level, palm trees and vehicles in place.
- [x] Static world (terrain, buildings) not drawn: VCALLMSR used vi[27] instead of
      CMSAR0, so the VU0 sector frustum test culled everything. Fixed; ground,
      buildings and the skyline render.
- [~] In-game speed: 11 -> ~55-60 VBlanks/s in gameplay (paced: never above 60) (compiled VU1, native VU0 box clip /
      matrix programs, texture/CLUT/upload/timer fixes, no FP contraction).
      Remaining: guest code ~31%, T4 swizzle ~9%, DMA chain copies ~7.5%
- [ ] Performance: per-instruction `ctx->pc` stores (emitter now skips them for
      pure ALU ops - needs a regenerate + test), `__restrict` for generated code

## Phase 4 - audio, input, memory card, movies
(Audio has been native since milestone 6 - the SPU2-emulation items below describe how it started; the current state
and the 2026-10-26 audit are under "Milestone 6".)
- [x] Input: keyboard + mouse + gamepad (docs/CONTROLS.md), verified in game: after the
      intro cutscene the player controls Vic at Fort Baxter (HUD, radar, mission marker)
- [x] Audio: SPU2 emulation (`ps2xIOP/.../iop_spu2.cpp`: 2x24 ADPCM voices, ADSR, loops,
      IRQ address, AutoDMA, IOP DMA 4/7) mixed to a 48 kHz host audio stream (SDL3 since stage 1 of NATIVE_RENDERER.md). Music, SFX and
      voices confirmed by ear. IOP time follows the wall clock, so audio no longer stutters
      when the game drops below 60 VBlanks/s (0 underruns at 20-60 VBlanks/s).
- [x] Audio: reverb, noise, pitch modulation, Gaussian interpolation, exact volume sweeps / ADSR timing
      (2026-10-23, from psx-spx; PS2RECOMP_PATCHES.md). VCS keeps reverb off and uses no PMON / NON in gameplay
      (game-internals.md 9), so what is audible is the interpolation and the envelopes
- [x] Memory card save: the game's own save routine writes its folder, icons and slot file
      to `%LOCALAPPDATA%/VCSRecomp/mc0` (verified with `VCS_TEST_SAVE`); boot finds the save
- [x] Memory card load (2026-10-22): the game finds its saves at start-up and loads the newest
      ("Load Successful", back at the save point) since `sceMcGetDir` lists folders in card order
      (PS2RECOMP_PATCHES.md); before, saves were written but never seen. Saving over a slot replaces its
      file (2026-10-23). Save (slot 2), Load Game (slot 1) and Delete Game through the game's own menus all work
      (2026-10-23, `tools/saves.py`, regress step "saves"; game-internals.md 10e)
- [x] Frontend menus render (pause menu, LOAD/NEW/DELETE menu when a save exists)
- [x] World vanishing when moving fast / driving: HW renderer never cleared the bottom half of
      the Z buffer (see PS2RECOMP_PATCHES.md, gs_hw.cpp depth fill)
- [x] Vic / vehicles / HUD flickering out in busy views: DMA chains were cut at 4096 tags.
      Cost: full frames are 7-14k tags; the title flyover dropped from ~45 to ~16 game fps.
      First perf recording: render submit (VIF/VU1/GS recording) 41 ms of a 61 ms frame,
      game code 15 ms, IOP 0.7 ms, GL execution 2.5 ms on the main thread.
- [~] Performance: render submit (title flyover, frames 10-60 s, ~245k vertices/frame):
      | step | render ms | game fps |
      |---|---|---|
      | start (full DMA chains) | 44.6 | 15.8 |
      | recycle HW frame records, chain buffers; perf counters per frame | 39.1 | 17.5 |
      | slice-addressed texture uploads | 39.9* | 16.9 |
      | lazy uploads (block level) | 36.8 | 18.3 |
      | texture binding cache | 33.9 | 19.3 |
      (* flyover load varies run to run; compare per-vertex.) Next: HwBackend::Submit (7%),
      VIF1 unpack (5%), compiled-VU1 pipeline bookkeeping (runLoop / progressXgkick /
      commitReadyPipelines ~8%), GS::writeRegisterPacked (4%), lazy-upload closure (3%).
- [x] Whole screen goes black for a few frames now and then - **no longer seen** in the user's testing
      (2026-10-24); gone with the renderer / timing work since (which change is not known). The report: (2026-10-22, after the
      DMA chain fix; not investigated yet). Still seen by the user after the native renderer
      (2026-10-22): objects and the world turn black for a few frames. To check first: whether
      it follows native draws (PS2X_HLE=0 run for comparison), the prelit colour stage inputs
      (0x9c-0x9e tint) and lighting constants at those moments, texture cache misses, and
      render-target drops (RtDrop) around the black frames.
- [x] Water surface looks missing (dark grey where sea should be): the sea draws (turquoise, waves) in the
      2026-10-23 tours - gone with the render-target fix (milestone 2)
- [x] Movies (milestone 5, 2026-10-24: played natively)
## Milestone 1 - automation and coverage rig (NATIVE_PORT_ROADMAP.md), started 2026-10-22
- [x] Control-channel extension (`ps2control::addCommand`) and the rig (`src/debug/rig.cpp`, `tools/rig.py`):
      memory peek / poke / search / dump, pause, frame counter
- [x] Script VM mapped (game-internals.md 11): `scm` runs our bytecode as a game script; teleport (area, scene
      load, ground find), time, weather, invincibility, health, mission launch (game's own loader) all work
- [x] Player ped, current area (interior) found (game-internals.md 12)
- [x] World tour (`tools/tour.py`): grid over the map, classes ok / water / relocated / falling / dark / slow /
      error, map image, screenshots, perf; restarts the game on a crash
- [x] Brightness probe (`PS2X_FRAME_STATS=1`, on with the control channel): every presented frame's middle
      region shrunk to 32x24 and read back; perf line `black_frames` / `dip_frames`; log lines
      `[frames] black run ...` (whole picture black) and `[frames] dip ...` (much darker than the scene for up to
      2 s). Normal walking / running: 0 of ~3000 frames; driving: one-game-frame full-black flashes seen
      ("dip of 2 host frames ... scene luma 113, lowest 0.9") - the user's black-flash bug, now measurable
- [x] Mission smoke test (`tools/missions.py`): each mission launched from a fresh load, screenshots, perf
- [x] Drive loop (`tools/drive.py`): car spawned by script, driven with the steering alternating
- [x] Regression suite (`tools/regress.py [--set-baseline]`): scenes + tour subset + missions + drive against a
      baseline, report.md
- [ ] Soak runs; in-process falling detector; unconverted-draw counter; map image with the land outline

## Milestone 2 - correctness sweep (started 2026-10-23)
Findings so far (rig runs; details in game-internals.md):
- [x] **Evening black frames** (the user's "world turns black"): fixed 2026-10-23 - render targets were tracked
      taller than the scissor, so the Z-area texture the game uploads at night dropped the picture
      (game-internals.md 6g). Regression check: `tools/regress.py` step "evening".
- [x] After a death the world near the hospital drew only lights for ~40 s - it was the evening black frames
      (fixed with them; checked 2026-10-23: drawn from the first frame after the respawn fade).
- [ ] Frame time in busy scenes: 35-39 ms (game code ~18 ms, render submit ~16 ms), drive loop mean 39 ms (was
      54 before the render-target fix). Profile (busy street, 2026-10-23): VIF1 processing 8%, T4 texture
      swizzle 7%, scheduler checkpoints 4%, the VU1 interpreter for the programs still on it (sprites 0x02c0, the
      env-map pass) ~8% together - milestones 3 and 7.
- [x] The VU path's darker noon picture was another symptom of the dropped render targets: after the fix native
      and VU path agree (hospital, luma 90 / 95 at 12:00, 73 / 76 at 20:00).
- [x] Black flashes at teleports / car warps are the game's own load transitions (not bugs).
- [x] "Relocations" after loading: the safehouse script (rig.Game.prime).
- [x] Sea: drawn correctly everywhere the full tour went (240 points, 2026-10-23); the old "dark grey sea" was
      the dropped render targets too.
- [x] Audio: the missing SPU2 features are implemented (reverb, Gaussian interpolation, PMON, noise, exact
      envelopes / sweeps) with unit tests; the game itself uses none of reverb / PMON / noise (traced over
      gameplay and missions 36-54: 0 of 532 samples) - it is a PSP game first.
- [x] Saves: save to another slot, Load Game, Delete Game through the game's own menus (`tools/saves.py`, regress
      step "saves"); a card written by older builds (the user's) loads in the current one.
- [x] Full mission smoke test (`tools/missions.py`, missions 6-100, 2026-10-23): 95 / 95 ok (started, no crash or
      hang, pictures); dark shots were fades and night cutscenes except one bug:
- [x] **GON_C3 poolside ground black** on the native path: GPU clipping of the packets the VU sends through its
      clipper. Clipped world packets stay on the VU1 by default now (`PS2X_HLE_CLIPPED=1` for GPU clipping); cost
      flyover 30 -> 25.5 game fps (render 18.2 -> 24.6 ms), cutscene / gameplay still at 30. Reproducing the VU's
      per-triangle clipper natively is milestone 3 (game-internals.md 6h).
- [x] Soak (`tools/soak.py --hours 0.5`, 2026-10-23; the user settled on a short one): 60 samples over 30 min of
      autodrive across six spots, no crash, hang or falling; private memory 347 MB at start, then a saw-tooth between
      486 and 560 MB from minute 10 on (streaming), no drift. Driving frame time median 46.8 ms, p90 70.7 ms. (The
      "6-8 ms worse with clipped packets on the VU1" read from this was wrong: a same-session A/B of `drive.py --auto`
      gave 54.8-57.1 ms mean for GPU, VU1 and C++ clipping alike - driving runs vary more than the clipping costs.)
      One car per leg spawned against something and was replaced (the tool's retry).

Milestone 2 closed 2026-10-23. Open, carried to milestone 3: the VU clipper reproduced natively, bloom buffers
dropped on uploads (lazy render-target patching).

## Milestone 3 - native rendering, the rest of the frame (started 2026-10-23)
- [x] **The VU1 clipper in C++** (`src/game/vcs_vu_clipper.cpp`, game-internals.md 6h): bit-exact against the VU's
      XGKICKs (GON_C3 1.2M GIF packets, reference scenes 2.8M, 0 off); clipped world packets drawn from it. Section
      means over the reference scenes (C++ / VU1 / GPU clipping): flyover render 14.6 / 17.7 / 14.1 ms, cutscene
      11.8 / 14.5 / 11.3, gameplay 5.9 / 7.6 / 5.6; flyover frame 34.3 ms (30 fps cap) vs 36.2 on the VU1. GON_C3's
      poolside ground right natively.
- [x] **Environment-map pass** (stage table 0x13, vehicles): reproduced and checked against the VU's kicks (27,243
      packets exact); native by default (`PS2X_HLE_ENV=0` = VU1). Flyover render 14.7 -> 14.0 ms (same-session A/B);
      pictures identical. game-internals.md 6d.
- [x] Survey reports native and VU1 work apart (`PS2X_HLE_STATS=1` also lists the stage tables left).
- [x] **0x02c0** (instanced re-draws, entry 0x1c; two-pass shine over resident meshes, entry 0x0d) and the **leftover
      prelit packets** (a float code image, "variant C") native: reproduced with their VU memory writes and checked
      against the VU (174,110 packets exact over the reference scenes; two missions and a drive exact too). Only clipped
      environment-pass packets still run on the VU1 (63 in two minutes of scenes). Render time 0.3-0.7 ms lower per
      section; pictures identical (game-internals.md 6d). `PS2X_HLE_REDRAW=0` = VU1. Milestone 3 step 1 done.
- [ ] **Step 2: 2D at the RenderWare level** (started 2026-10-23). Found: Im2D (FUN_002fbe08 / FUN_002fbe68), its
      vertex format, RwRenderStateSet, CHud::Draw (FUN_0031c628) and the 2D pass's order (game-internals.md 6f);
      `src/game/vcs_hud.cpp` hooks them.
  - [x] **16:9 weapon icon at the screen edge** (reported by the user): the icon is drawn off the far plane, so the
        renderer's HUD placement missed it; HUD-context primitives without a depth test now get the HUD's z. Checked at
        16:9 (icon beside the clock / ammo as at 4:3, radar still round) and over the reference scenes (no other
        change). `VCS_HUD_RW=0` = before.
  - [x] **Per-element anchoring**: HUD "Screen edges" (`VCS_HUD=2`) - each HUD element squeezed towards the edge it
        sits near (radar left; clock / weapon / money / zone name right; help text left), the elements found from the
        frame's Im2D calls (game-internals.md 6f, DECISIONS.md).
  - [x] **Native HUD layer**: the HUD's primitives kept out of the PS2 frame buffer and drawn over the shown picture
        at the window's size (NATIVE_RENDERER.md "HUD layer"); on by default, `VCS_HUD_NATIVE=0` = into the frame
        buffer. Textures from the GS backend's decoded cache, not a RenderWare raster decoder (DECISIONS.md).
        Checked with `scenes.py` at 4:3 and 16:9 against `VCS_HUD_NATIVE=0` (build/m3/cmp43, cmp169): same HUD, the
        radar round and clipped, the static scenes (loading 0.95, pause map 0.8-0.9 mean difference) as close as two
        runs of one build; at 16:9 the HUD is sharper (no squeeze-then-stretch). No cost: 4:3 flyover 29.3 -> 30.0
        fps, gameplay at the 30 fps cap in both.
  - [x] **Lines in the HUD at full-screen sizes** (reported by the user at 1080p: a line through the radar's north
        icon, lines under / beside the clock's digits): sub-pixel gaps and atlas bleeding that 640x448 never showed.
        The layer now covers the PS2's pixels and samples inside each quad's own texels (NATIVE_RENDERER.md "HUD
        layer"). Checked at 1920x1080 (`PS2X_HW_OUTPUT`) outside the barracks; at 640x448 the layer still matches the
        emulated HUD.
  - [x] **Menus** in the native layer (pause menu pages; NATIVE_RENDERER.md "HUD layer"): sharper at 1080p, same
        layout and colours (scenes at 16:9 1080p against `VCS_MENU_NATIVE=0`: static scenes the same but the pause
        map, which differs by its sharper text). HUD placement default stays "Keep 4:3"; "Screen edges" is the menu
        choice Display > HUD (user's decision).
  - [x] **Loading screens** in the native layer (2026-10-24; FULLY_NATIVE.md step 2): `LoadingScreen` (FUN_0021E170)
        opens a context like the menu's (centred, full-width pieces stretched) to its frame kick. Static `loading`
        scene 1.12 against the reference (ok); at 1080p the progress bar and its shadow draw at the output's
        resolution instead of a scaled-up 640x448 frame. `VCS_LOADING_NATIVE=0` = into the frame buffer. There is no
        title menu (game-internals.md 6f: the game boots into the opening sequence; the frontend is the pause menu).
- [x] **Textures without emulated VRAM in steady state** (2026-10-24, FULLY_NATIVE.md step 3a): CLUT loads take the
      palette from the queued upload that wrote it, and data-less upload calls no longer force the queue; swizzled VRAM
      writes while driving ~245k -> ~7 per 5 s, render worker idle 27% -> 41% on the drive (`writeRectFast` was 11% of
      its samples). Verify: 2.7M CLUT loads the same as from VRAM. Scenes ok, tour classes unchanged (frame p90 19.1 ->
      15.6 ms). `PS2X_HW_CLUT_FROM_UPLOAD=0` = from VRAM.
- [x] **Streamed uploads cheaper** (2026-10-24, FULLY_NATIVE.md step 3b): PATH2 packets processed in place, packet / upload
      buffers reused, a four-lane upload hash; render worker busy on the drive ~59% -> ~50% of samples, standing worker
      -0.3 to -0.5 ms (A/B, alternating).
- [x] **Textures decoded from their uploads** (2026-10-24, FULLY_NATIVE.md step 3c): a texture cache miss reads the
      queued upload's data at each texel's VRAM address (`GSMem::PixelBits`) instead of emulated VRAM; ~4,100 decodes over
      the reference scenes identical to VRAM's. Left in VRAM: the loading screen's art (its upload arrives in pieces).
      `PS2X_HW_DECODE_FROM_UPLOAD=0` = from VRAM.
- [x] **Textures named by raster, render targets by role** (2026-10-24, FULLY_NATIVE.md step 3d): every texture made
      over the reference scenes and the drive named by the game's raster (RAM address) through the chain's upload REFs;
      targets named by the game (`gsHwSetTargetRole`), the reflection map at the window's resolution. Step 3 done.
- [x] **Unchanged world / model blocks not copied** (2026-10-24, FULLY_NATIVE.md step 4a / 4b): guest RAM under the
      OS's write watch; a block whose pages are unchanged since a confirmed copy is replayed from its recording without
      being copied (2.4M decisions checked, 0 wrong). Chain copy per frame 4.6 -> 2.1 MB; drive 50 -> 54 fps, worker
      -0.5 ms (A/B alternating). "Other call" packets skipped too since 2026-10-25 (a 12-byte
      over-skip in the MARK handler had lost their marks; 2.06M decisions checked, 0 wrong). `VCS_RSL_SKIP=0` = copy everything.
- [x] **Draw calls as items** (2026-10-25, FULLY_NATIVE.md step 4c; step 4 done): world / model draws with a native
      flush write one 16-byte CNT (MARK) instead of their GS packet and CALL / REF; flush, GS registers and block go to
      the worker as an item, the block decided at the kick. Sectors cached by `FUN_00240ED8` keep their packets (the game
      sends the copy again). Verify: 3.0M draws / 1.4M blocks 0 differ. Speed even (the copy savings came with 4b).
      `VCS_RSL_ITEMS=0` = packets.
- [x] **State setters as item ops** (2026-10-25, FULLY_NATIVE.md step 5a): the GS queue senders, texture matrix,
      `FUN_001CEF18`, `FUN_002F9CE8` and all-CNT state flushes become VIF-byte ops in the item stream (not while a
      sector / material is cached). Verify 2.67M draws / ops 0 differ. `VCS_RSL_OPS=0` = their packets.
- [x] **Texture uploads as reference ops** (2026-10-25, FULLY_NATIVE.md step 5b): `FUN_003298D8`'s header and pixel
      REFs become references in the item stream, their payloads copied at the kick with their raster names. Verify
      4.85M draws / ops 0 differ; chain payload ~22k -> ~7.9k qwords a frame. `VCS_RSL_UPLOADS=0` = their REFs.
- [x] **Im2D as ops** (2026-10-25, FULLY_NATIVE.md step 5c): `FUN_002FB690`'s packet, as the game writes it, becomes an
      op at the next hook point (cursor rewound). 803k captured packets unchanged at the kick; HUD / pause-map scenes as
      before. `VCS_RSL_IM2D=0` = the packets.
- [x] **The other packet writers captured** (2026-10-25, FULLY_NATIVE.md step 5d): 16 effect / immediate-geometry /
      frame writers captured like Im2D, nesting told apart by the guest stack pointer, a region's convertible front
      taken when other packets follow it (NEXT over them). 766k regions unchanged at the kick. Drive census ~1,090 ->
      ~740 tags a frame.
- [x] **VU1 code uploads and double-buffer setup in recordings** (2026-10-25, FULLY_NATIVE.md step 5e in part): BASE /
      OFFSET / ITOP / MPG recorded as raw VIF bytes and replayed through the interpreter; the render-context packets
      ("other calls") all replayable now (15.6k refused per 10 s before). 1.79M recordings 0 differ. `VCS_RSL_RAW=0`.
- [x] **Plug-in callbacks in the native flush** (2026-10-25, FULLY_NATIVE.md step 5f in part): the two `+0x50`
      callbacks that write constants (`FUN_001CEF18`, `FUN_0040F6C8`) written natively (~50k flushes per 5 s driving);
      ~36k of ~870k flushes per 10 s still left to the original. 1.62M flushes 0 differ. `VCS_RSL_PLUGINS=0`.
- [x] **Captured regions take CALLs; fallback draws captured** (2026-10-25, FULLY_NATIVE.md step 5f done): a CALL in a
      captured region becomes the block of a continuation item (copied / skipped at the kick like a model item's); draws
      whose flush calls guest code run the original and their region is captured; draws inside regions leave the
      frame's draw list (the walker's matching was out of step: model items 31k -> 90k per 10 s driving). Im3D all ops.
      1.51M regions, 3.38M draws / ops, 640k blocks, 1.54M recordings: 0 differ. `VCS_RSL_DRAW_CAPTURE=0`,
      `VCS_RSL_CAPTURE_CALLS=0`.
- [x] **Gaps and runs** (2026-10-26, FULLY_NATIVE.md step 5h): what any code writes between two hook points is taken
      into items in place; regions taken in runs around the tags that must stay; texture binds captured. Driving chain
      742 -> 303 top-level tags a frame (245 items, ~32 NEXTs, ~16 fixed root tags), payload 780 -> 232 qwords. 2.15M
      regions unchanged, 0 tags reading inside one, 3.34M draws / ops, 631k blocks, 1.40M recordings: 0 differ.
      `VCS_RSL_GAPS=0`, `VCS_RSL_RUNS=0`.
- [x] **No GS front-end draws** (2026-10-26, FULLY_NATIVE.md 5e): the three render-target reads (A+D runs continuing
      an earlier PRIM, state writes before PRIM) and the flyover's Im2D line strip drawn by the packed path; 7.5M
      packets exact against per-primitive `Submit`. `gs_draws` 0 in the reference scenes and the tour subset.
- [x] **Native in every mission** (2026-10-26): mission smoke test, all 95 missions ok (the 14 whose script ends
      within 45 s of a fresh load do so on the earlier build too); GS-path draws 0 everywhere after MAR_A1's second
      0x0030 code image was accepted (verify exact: 1.55M packets). FULLY_NATIVE.md "Where it stands": point 2 of
      "done" holds. `PS2X_HLE_IMAGE2=0`.
- [ ] **Step 3: post effects** (started 2026-10-23; NATIVE_RENDERER.md "Post effects", game-internals.md 6g).
  - [x] **GS pixel centres**: the renderer sampled half a pixel off the GS, so VCS's per-frame copies blurred the
        picture (softer than the PS2 at 640x448). Fixed for every draw; `PS2X_HW_PIXEL_CENTRE=0` = before.
  - [x] **Higher internal resolutions kept through the copies** (`rtFull`): before, the shown picture was always a
        640x448 copy scaled up. `PS2X_HW_RT_FULL=0` = before.
  - [x] **Bloom and trails as native passes** with widescreen-correct proportions (NATIVE_RENDERER.md "Post
        effects"): at 4:3 640x448 the same picture as the emulation (static regions within run-to-run noise), at 16:9
        the glow / warp no longer a third wider than at 4:3. `PS2X_HW_POSTFX=0` = as recorded.
  - [x] Frame copy and motion blur as native passes (texture copy / one full-screen quad); the self-copy over the
        sky stays a GS draw (depth-tested, read at full resolution).
- [ ] **Step 4: native frame** (started 2026-10-23; NATIVE_RENDERER.md "Native frame").
  - [x] Per-target scales; "Internal resolution: Match window" draws the picture's targets at the window's size
        (1920x1080 at 16:9 1080p), the effect buffers at 1x. Default stays 1x (the original).
  - [x] MSAA (2x-8x) and anisotropic filtering (2x-16x) as options, off by default (NATIVE_RENDERER.md "Native frame").
  - [x] The reflection map at the window's resolution with "Match window" (2026-10-24, FULLY_NATIVE.md step 3d); the
        radar has no target of its own (drawn in the HUD layer, already at the window's resolution).
- [x] **Draw-source counter** (2026-10-24; NATIVE_RENDERER.md "Draw sources"): what each frame still draws through
      the GS path, by source (VU1 program, C++ reproduction, PATH2, PATH3) - perf line `gs_*`, overlay, the rig's
      `gsdraws`, tour / missions record it. Survey: no PATH3; PATH2 ~15 draws (reflection map, coronas, effect quads);
      45-90 draws from the C++ reproductions' GIF packets; VU1 draws only from clipped / culled 0x02c0 shine packets.
- [x] **Clipped and culled 0x02c0 shine packets natively** (2026-10-24, game-internals.md 6d): the second pass is the
      clipper again with tag 50. PHI_A1 verify: 421,694 packets exact (9,629 clipped, 26,518 culled shines). VU1 draws
      0 in the tour subset and 12 missions.
- [x] **VU1 XGKICKs went to the GS twice** (found with the counter; PS2RECOMP_PATCHES.md): `PS2X_HLE=0` scenes drew
      ~2x the vertices (cutscene 220,848 -> 122,823). Default path unchanged (scenes 0.00 static).
- [x] **VU1 setup programs natively** (2026-10-24, game-internals.md 6d "Setup programs"): 0x0000, 0x0148, 0x01e0,
      0x0250, 0x03a8, 0x0418, 0x0478, 0x2b50 and the slot routines 0xc8 / lit 0x4e0 / lit 0x57e, each tied to a hash of
      its code; verify exact against the whole VU memory (reference scenes 434,692, PHI_A1 217,489, a city spot
      80,557). Two more 0x02c0 code images accepted (they differ only in code the shine never runs). VU1 programs a
      frame: cutscene 195 -> 4, gameplay 86 -> 4, tour subset mean 104.6 -> 3.4 (worker 8.76 -> 8.05 ms); no VU1
      draws anywhere in the tour subset or the 12 missions. `PS2X_HLE_SETUP=0` = VU1.
- [x] **World draws from the RSL world draw calls** (2026-10-24, milestone 7 / RSL_SUBMISSION.md phase 2): the world
      draw's REF replaced by a VIF MARK as the chain is copied, the block drawn there from a recording (UNPACK results,
      MSCALs, meshes) - no copy, VIF parsing, unpacking, hashing or vertex conversion of world geometry. Verify: 174,301
      replays against the packet path, 0 differ. Timing within noise (world geometry is ~5% of VIF1's payload).
      `VCS_RSL_WORLD=0` = packet path.
- [x] **Model instances from the RSL draw calls** (2026-10-24, RSL_SUBMISSION.md phase 2): the CALLed packets of
      `FUN_002F7D58` / `FUN_002F80A0` (and every other CALL in the packet buffer) recorded once - the whole CALL ... RET
      stream, DIRECT GS data, STCYCL, all draw programs - and replayed at a MARK the chain walker puts before them. The
      marked bytes now stay in the chain's copy and are skipped (world blocks too: the old REF replacement read guest
      memory when the worker processed the chain, possibly after streaming replaced it). Replays write only the fields
      an UNPACK wrote (found by the verify: V3 / write-protected w lanes). Verify: 1,217,887 blocks over a bench run,
      0 differ. Render worker (one bench run each): Fort Baxter 5.5 -> 4.2 ms, busy city spot 10.8 -> 9.2, drive
      15.8 -> 13.4. Scenes ok, tour classes unchanged. `VCS_RSL_MODELS=0` = packet path.
- [x] **Game thread: chain copy, VU0, state flush** (2026-10-24, RSL_SUBMISSION.md "The game thread after phase 2"):
      a caller-aware drive profile found the VIF1 chain copy reallocating every frame (pool fixed: ~10% -> ~5.7% of
      the game thread), four VU0 programs still interpreted (0x0C10, 0x0068, 0x0E98, 0x0E30: native, `PS2X_VU0_VERIFY`
      0 differ; ~5%), and the RSL state flush (native for flushes without plug-in callbacks, byte-exact over ~700k
      flushes; 2.3% -> 1.3%). A/B, two alternating rounds: drive game thread 18.6 -> 17.8 ms, 45.8 -> 51.0 fps.
      Scenes ok, tour classes unchanged. `VCS_RSL_NATIVE=0` = the original flush.
- [x] **Packed draws** (2026-10-24, NATIVE_RENDERER.md "Draw sources"): the C++ reproductions' strips / fans recorded
      without the GS front end (`GS::submitPackedKick`), verified exact against the per-vertex recording (14M packets).
      Render worker at the busiest bench spot 14.5 -> 11.7 ms, AI drive 21.2 -> 18.2 ms (one bench run each).
      `PS2X_HLE_PACKED=0` = front end.
- [x] **No VU1 in a normal frame** (2026-10-24, game-internals.md 6d): the Z-clear image's programs (0x0000, 0x0200,
      0x0400), the last 0x0250 (slot routines now named by the hash of their code) and table-0x13 packets through the
      clipper reproduced; verify exact (PHI_A1 setup programs 160,468; reference scenes env pass 23,913 with 216
      clipped). `vu1_programs` 0 in the reference scenes and at all 18 tour-subset points. The emulated VU1 stays as
      the reference (`PS2X_HLE=0`, `PS2X_HLE_SETUP=0`, `PS2X_HLE_VERIFY=1`).
- [ ] Rigid / skinned lit models still use GPU clipping for their clipped packets (no wrong picture seen yet; same
      method when one shows up).
- [ ] Lazy render-target patching (bloom buffers dropped on uploads).


## Milestone 4 - frame rate (started 2026-10-23)

- [x] Main loop, VBlank handler, frame limiter and CTimer mapped (game-internals.md 4).
- [x] 60 fps switch (Display > Frame rate, `VCS_FPS=60`; off by default): the limiter lets a frame through after one
      VBlank. On the i7-7700K it reaches 31-37 fps in gameplay: the game thread needs ~27 ms a frame (milestone 7
      first for a steady 60).
- [x] Performance (milestone 7 work, 2026-10-23): VU0 collision programs 0x020 / 0x3A0 native (bit-exact): game code
      19-24 -> ~12 ms a frame; 60 fps mode 31-37 -> 45-50 fps outside the barracks (render submission ~8 ms is next).
- [x] Render submission, round 1 (all checked against the old path): VU1 code-write log (only re-uploaded ranges
      re-decoded); UNPACK fast path (`PS2X_VIF_UNPACK_FAST=verify`); rect uploads with hoisted addressing and whole
      PSMT4 blocks (`PS2X_GS_RECT_VERIFY=1`); lazy uploads found through a per-block index (`PS2X_HW_LAZY_INDEX=0` for
      the old scan). 60 mode outside the barracks 45-50 -> 56-60 fps (frame 16.6-17.8 ms: game ~10.5, render ~6).
      Driving (AI car from Fort Baxter, `fpsdrive.py`) is the hard case: 24-28 -> 26-29 fps, ~1,700 draws a frame,
      game ~18 ms + render ~17 ms one after the other on the game thread; 30 mode also dips to 27-28 there. Holding 60
      when driving needs render submission off the game thread (VIF1 / VU1 / GS front end on a worker), not more
      trimming.
- [x] Render submission worker (2026-10-23, NATIVE_RENDERER.md "Render submission worker", `PS2X_RENDER_THREAD=0`
      for the old path): chains, VU1 and the GS front end run on their own thread behind the game thread. 60 mode:
      outside the barracks at the cap with ~4 ms to spare; driving 26-29 -> 44-54 fps; flyover 42.5 -> 59.9 fps.
      Game code (~17-20 ms driving) is now the limit.
- [x] Game code (2026-10-23): inline dispatch / checkpoint fast paths (`PS2X_FAST_DISPATCH=0` to compare) and a
      ThinLTO + profile-guided build (`tools/build.py --opt pgo`, trained on `tools/bench.py` + the reference scenes).
      `tools/bench.py`, 60 mode, game-thread ms (two runs each):

      | spot | plain /O2 | + fast dispatch | + PGO + ThinLTO |
      |---|---|---|---|
      | Fort Baxter | 10.8 / 11.0 | 13.1 / 13.3 (more draws) | 9.7 / 10.8 |
      | city 575,175 | 7.9 / 8.2 | 6.7 / 7.5 | 5.9 / 6.0 |
      | city -675,1425 | 14.5 / 13.6 | 13.2 / 14.2 | 9.1 / 9.3 |
      | city 1325,-325 | 9.6 / 11.4 | 8.4 / 8.9 | 7.2 / 7.5 |
      | city -1425,-575 | 12.2 / 12.2 | 10.5 / 11.3 | 8.0 / 8.3 |
      | AI drive | 22.9 / 21.8 (40.6 / 42.6 fps) | 20.3 / 20.3 (45 fps) | 16.4 / 16.9 (56.7 / 55.1 fps) |

      Fast dispatch alone is ~1 ms (dispatch / checkpoint / lookup left the profile but their work stays inline);
      PGO + ThinLTO ~20-30% of game code. Checked: static reference scenes unchanged (loading 0.00, pause map 0.33),
      world tour subset classes unchanged, its worst frame 21.0 -> 16.7 ms. Remaining on the game thread (driving):
      game code ~65%, memmove ~3%, VU0 programs ~6%, IOP ~2%.

      Retrained 2026-10-24 (after RSL phase 2 and the game-thread work: `--opt pgo --train`, ~45 min). A/B against
      the same code without PGO (`--opt none`), two alternating rounds: standing at Fort Baxter 11.7-12.9 -> 8.1-9.3 ms,
      AI drive 19.4-20.2 -> 14.8 ms (44.6-46.9 -> 56.8-56.9 fps). Reference scenes all ok (a first capture right
      after the build caught `loading` / `flyover_base` on black / mid-fade frames - timing; the next capture matched,
      `loading` at the usual 1.17).
- [x] Frame-rate independence, phase 1 - timing (2026-10-23): Display > Game timing (Original / Frame-rate
      independent, restart) and Frame rate cap (30 / 60 / 120 / 144 / display refresh / unlimited). Independent:
      host-clock CTimer in whole ms, the 0.5 minimum step lifted, host pacing in the limiter, frames presented as the
      game finishes them, EE clock kept at real time on the VBlank chain. Game clock = wall clock at 30 and 144
      (was 1.5-4% slow from CTimer's per-frame ms truncation, in original timing too). Original timing unchanged
      (static reference scenes 0.00). game-internals.md 4.
- [x] Frame-rate independence, phase 2 - audit rig (2026-10-24): `tools/framerate_audit.py` runs fall / run /
      sprint / jump / car / clock scenarios at forced steps (`VCS_TIMESTEP`), compared per simulated second.
      Findings: steps below 0.5 break ped movement (independent timing capped at 100 fps, DECISIONS.md); in
      1/15-1/100 car acceleration and running agree, falling and jumping vary with the rate (+7% fall time,
      +6-9% jump height from 30 to 60-100). game-internals.md 4 has the numbers and the frame counter worklist.
- [x] Measured on the PGO + ThinLTO build (2026-10-24), independent timing: game clock = wall clock (x1.001) at
      caps 60 and 100; cap 100 runs 91 fps outside the barracks, `tools/bench.py --fps 100 VCS_TIMING=1`: city
      spots 80-100 fps, AI drive 68 fps (game 13.7 ms, worker 14.0 ms). Original timing unchanged (static
      reference scenes 0.00).
- [x] User playtest (2026-10-24): missions play well in frame-rate independent timing at 60 and 100 fps.
- [ ] Well past 100 fps everywhere (started 2026-10-25, docs/PERFORMANCE.md). Done: guest memory accesses with one
      compare and the scratchpad inline (game thread ~2x faster), lean pc and `__restrict ctx` in the recompiler, the EE
      clock no longer holding the game at ~100 fps, the flip's CSR read without the render-worker fence, the main loop
      unpaced for an unlimited cap. Uncapped (`--opt none`): Fort Baxter 111 -> 209 fps, city spots 118-166 -> 135-331,
      AI drive 95 -> 126 fps. Then the ped-movement bug below step 0.5 patched: independent timing goes up to 240
      fps (was 100). Then the render worker split in two (the GS stage), guest functions without register saves
      (preserve_none), smaller game-thread items, PGO retrained. PGO build, independent timing, unlimited (= 240):
      Fort Baxter 223 fps, city 201-240, AI drive 150, world tour (40 points) median 208 / slowest 120; 30-minute
      uncapped soak clean. Left: heavy views (~1,950 draws) at ~120 fps - game thread and render worker both ~6-8 ms.
- [ ] Frame-rate independence, phases 3-4. Done: falling / jumping explained (Euler integration error, <= 6%, not a
      bug - game-internals.md 4); real-time pacing checked (game clock = wall clock at caps 60 / 100 / refresh,
      presents at the cap). HUD / radar flashing at the original rate above 30 fps (2D pass on a 30 Hz frame counter). Left: the four
      blinking readers outside the 2D pass;
      what breaks below step 0.5 (FUN_00337208's max(step, 0.5), CBike's lean, patched 2026-10-28) to lift the 100 cap; missions at 60 / 100
      (driving, shooting, flying, cutscenes); VRR / frame-time variance. (Phase 1 / 2 above; the user's choice over interpolation, DECISIONS.md 2026-10-23): CTimer on the host
      clock, a frame-rate cap setting, a forced-step test rig, then the audit of frame-count assumptions. Replaces
      the "60 fps fixes" item below.
- [x] Mission meters on the time step (2026-10-27, user report: PHI_A2 "Boomshine Blowout"'s heat bar filled far
      faster at 144 fps). The mission adds fixed amounts per frame (heat floor +0.015, heat +-1); a survey of all of
      MAIN.SCM (disassembled: every bar's variables, every per-frame float rate, every int counter) found the same in 11
      more: LOU_B1 girls, UMB_B2 havoc, DIA_C2 time, REN_C3 Phil, UMB_B3 stress rates, FIREHEL water / heli damage,
      MEN_C6 pressure, the driving range / GON_C2 aim, DIA_C4 searchlights, LOU_B2 escape distances. 30 instructions
      scaled by step / (50/30) in the script VM's arithmetic handlers (`src/game/vcs_script_timing.cpp`), only when
      the frame isn't the PS2's. PHI_A2 at 1/144: heat floor 2.162 -> 0.4496 a second (0.450 at 1/30), heat at +1:
      144 -> 29.5 (29.1 at 1/30). `framerate_audit.py` scenario `heat`, `--sites` (all 30 found). game-internals.md 11f.
- [x] Vehicle physics on the time step (2026-10-28, user report: at high frame rates a car running over someone jumped
      far more than it should, and a stolen bike sometimes flipped forward). Two per-frame amounts without the step:
      FUN_003F34F0 pushes a wheel up once a frame while a dead or knocked-down ped is under it (the bump of a body;
      cars and bikes), and ProcessWheel's rolling resistance (no gas, no brake) is a fixed brake a frame (reVC fixes
      the same line under FIX_BUGS). At 144 fps a car over a body pitched up until its rear bumper hit the road and
      threw it up at 3.9 m/s (1.4 at 30), a bike rolling past the rider it was stolen from ended on its nose or side,
      a car coasted down at 16 m/s^2 (3.4) and a bike at 11 (2.4, hard enough to pitch it forward). Both scaled by
      step / (50/30) when the frame is shorter (`src/game/vcs_physics_timing.cpp`, `VCS_PHYSICS_TIMESTEP=0` off; the
      brake's constants patched to load from guest RAM 0x7FF00..), and CBike's lean `max(step, 0.5)` patched like the
      ped one (a gentle turn leant 22 degrees at 144 fps against 30). After: coasting 3.45 / 3.45 / 3.45 m/s^2 at 1/30
      / 60 / 144, the run-over pitch rate 0.042 / 0.043 / 0.041, the bike past a body upright at all three.
      `framerate_audit.py` scenarios coast, runover, bikebody, bikecoast, bikelean; game-internals.md 4. Found with the
      rig's new `trace` (a vehicle's state every frame) and write watches attributing its speed changes to callers.
      Then the same `max(step, 0.5)` in vehicles and bikes in water and a boat's rudder, patched: at 144 fps a car kept
      1.6 m/s one second into the sea (0.6 at 30), a bike sank to the bottom; after, 0.76 m/s and the bike settles 2.95 m
      deep (2.75 at 30). `framerate_audit.py` carwater, bikewater. Left: the ped ones (CPed::ProcessControl).
- [ ] Fixes for what changes at the shorter step (physics, animations, script waits, particles, camera), each behind
      the switch; frame pacing. Left from the script survey (game-internals.md 11f): per-frame object / camera /
      text animations in missions (looks only).
## Milestone 5 - movies (2026-10-24) - done
- [x] STINGS.PSS (the Rockstar logos) and INTRO.PSS play natively at boot (`src/game/vcs_movie.cpp`): own PSS
      demuxer, MPEG-2 video through FFmpeg, shown by the presenter at 4:3 (pillarboxed in widescreen), 48 kHz PCM
      sound mixed into the audio output and used as the clock. Checked: logos 10.8 s, 321 pictures, none dropped;
      Start during the logos ignored (as on the PS2), the intro skipped by Start, the game then loads the save.
- [x] Display > Skip intro movies (`display.skip_intro`, `VCS_SKIP_MOVIES`; off = play them as on the PS2).
      Test tools (run.py, the rig, scenes) default to skipping them.
## Milestone 6 - retire the IOP (started 2026-10-24)
- [x] Step 1, streaming: CDSTREAM's stream server (RPC 0x65686577) replaced on the EE side by host-thread reads from
      the disc image (`src/game/vcs_stream.cpp`, `VCS_NATIVE_STREAM=0` for the IOP's). Loading as fast as before
      (boot 6.3-7.8 s, five LOAD_SCENE teleports 2.1 s - the game is the limit, not the reads: 14 MB in ~5 ms).
      Static reference scenes unchanged; world tour subset clean.
- [x] Step 2, sound (2026-10-24): CDSTREAM's two sound servers ported to the host (`src/game/vcs_sound.cpp`, the
      effects and music engines) on a native libsd (`src/sound/libsd.cpp`) and an SPU2 core of their own (the
      emulator's SPU2 class, now public), which is the audio output; `VCS_NATIVE_SOUND=0` for the IOP's. Tables the
      module carries (stream names, SPU2 addresses) are read from the disc's own CDSTREAM.IRX. Checked against the
      emulated IOP on identical input with `tools/soundcheck.py` (the IOP run's sound RPCs recorded with their IOP
      times and replayed into the native driver): **PHI_A1 + cutscene preload: 11 of 12 sounding 5 s windows
      bit-identical to the emulated IOP's output**, the 12th spans a jump in the reference's own timing; an AI drive
      with the radio: 99.5% of 19,314 SPU2 register writes / DMAs in the same second, none of the reference's
      missing, the rest of the audio differs by +-1-sample event timing (the emulated SPU2 runs up to one IOP batch
      behind the IOP clock). Found on the way: the radio started at volume 0 for 0.45 s after a station change (the
      preload must take its DMA time - game-internals.md 9a). The loop at a stream's end (no capture reaches one):
      a synthetic call sequence opening FLASH.VB 3 s before its end with looping on plays 13 s on without a gap.
      Fixed 2026-10-24 (the user heard it): bike engines restarting every frame, cars playing rev samples while
      slowing - the native "is voice v playing" (`0xA0A00`) read another voice's envelope. Same bike / car ride:
      156 key-ons on the IOP, 676 before the fix, 126 after; 0 / 91 / 0 voices re-triggered in back-to-back frames.
      The recordings now carry each call's reply and the replay compares them (43,138 calls: 21 differ, all a load or
      stop finishing sooner natively) - the check that would have caught it.
      Checked 2026-10-24 after the user missed handbrake screech and some door sounds: on scripted handbrake turns
      and exits / entries the game asks for the same sounds natively as on the emulated IOP (skid hiss 239, squeal 97,
      door open 217 / shut 216: 8 door sounds in both, at matching moments), the replay matches the IOP's replies, and
      through the strongest skid the native output equals the reference within ~1% loudness per quarter second.
      Same at the original 30 fps timing. Not reproduced as a native-driver difference; open until the user compares
      by ear with `VCS_NATIVE_SOUND=0`. (The scripted turns ran partly on sand, where GTA plays no screech.)
      2026-10-24, the user (comparing with the original): no tyre screech on a bike at speed with R1 held while
      turning, with native and emulated sound alike. On the airport runway the game does request the screech
      (sound 260, volume 25-36, pitch 16-18k, held through the skid; game-internals.md 9a) and the SPU2 plays it
      (voice output peak ~4000 against ~8300 for the engine; replay = live output). The user heard no screech in
      that clip: it was on voice 19, core 0 - see the next entry.
      **Fixed 2026-10-26: every sound on SPU2 core 0 was silent** (the user: machine-gun bursts where "only one bullet
      out of a few" sounds; also the missing screech and the doors that "sometimes" don't play). The SPU2 core fed
      core 0's output into core 1 through BVOL (the AutoDMA input's volume) instead of AVOL ("core external input",
      only core 1), and decoded both as sweepable volumes: libsd's sceSdInit sets core 1 AVOL 0x7FFF / BVOL 0, so core
      0 reached the output at volume 0 (0x7FFF as a fixed volume is -2). Both are plain signed 16-bit volumes (PCSX2:
      ExtVol / InpVol = SignExtend16). The game's 44 effect voices are core 0's 24 + 20 of core 1's, used in turn:
      ~70% of an M249 burst's shots (54 of 76) landed on core 0. Live after the fix: 76 of 76 shots sound; the bike's
      screech and its engine come through (a ride ~10x louder overall). Native and emulated sound share the SPU2
      core, so both had it - why the soundcheck comparisons agreed. `--iop-tests` checks a core 0 voice now.
      Mapping tools: `tools/irxdis.py --map / --decompile`
      (headless Ghidra), `tools/mipsdis.py` (MIPS I, standard library).
- [x] Step 3 (2026-10-24): no emulated IOP in the normal run - no IRX module loaded or run, no IOP time emulated
      (`retireIop`, game-internals.md 9b); `PS2X_IOP=1` runs it again (`VCS_NATIVE_SOUND=0` / `VCS_NATIVE_STREAM=0`
      do too). Boot to gameplay 4.9-6.1 s in all three configurations (game-bound); IOP 0.2 ms per frame (was
      0.3-0.4). Memory card save / Load Game / Delete Game through the menus pass (`tools/saves.py`, whose load check
      now looks at where the player ends up: the runtime's `[MC]` log lines arrive late). Tour subset (`--every 9
      --limit 18`): 15 ok, 2 relocated, 1 falling - identical with the IOP off, on, and everything emulated. Six story
      missions (JER_A3, PHI_A1, MAR_A1, LOU_A1, LAN_B1, BRY_B1) run without problems with the IOP off.
- [x] **Audio audit (2026-10-26)**: every sound path is native in the normal run. All 95 missions of the smoke test log
      the native sound driver and the emulated IOP off, with no sound / stream / libsd warning (libsd's one unported
      case, `VoiceTrans` modes other than 0, never occurs). Movie sound goes through FFmpeg into the same output.
      `tools/soundcheck.py` again against the emulated IOP: MAR_A1's opening cutscene 99.89% of 23,875 SPU2 writes
      in the same second, loudness envelopes correlating 0.999, 9 of 10 sounding windows within -40 dB (most of them
      identical); an AI drive with radio station changes 99.42% of 34,658 writes, envelopes 0.949, each 5 s window
      as loud as the reference within ~2 dB (sample-level differences are the known +-1-sample event timing). A
      live native recording of the same drive changes stations like the IOP: stops completed in 37-427 ms (IOP
      1-385 ms), every stream open accepted. Fixed in the check itself: a replayed stream open could land while a
      native stop was still finishing (the IOP's had taken 1 ms), be refused and leave the music engine out of step
      for the rest of the replay (4,580 replies "differing"); live the game polls the state until 0 first, so the
      replay now lets native time run as those polls would (one open waited 308 ms). The roadmap's "Where we are"
      table, still showing IRX modules and SPU2 emulation, now shows the current state.
- [x] **Long-run spikes** (2026-10-26, PERFORMANCE.md 14): an unused upstream VAG decode on sound-file reads removed,
      zlib's inflate_fast native (verified: 4,096 calls the same), the 30-second model-id search native, texture decodes
      straight from same-layout uploads (3,500 the same as VRAM). 24-minute soak: p99 13.7 -> 11.9 ms, frames over 17 ms
      357 -> 203, game-caused frames over 25 ms away from teleports 39 -> 15; what remains are loads.
- [ ] Open (found 2026-10-24, not milestone 6): tour point (-925, 1175) falls through the world when the tour reaches
      it after the points before it, in every configuration; a fresh teleport there from Fort Baxter lands (z 14.5).
      Collision streaming order / timing at that spot needs a look.
## Phase 5 - stability
- [x] Shakedown (MAR_A1): characters floating over / sunk into the ground in the opening cutscene, and the game stuck on
      "Loading..." when entering the shop (user report 2026-10-25) - **fixed 2026-10-25**, two separate bugs
      (game-internals.md 4 and 12). The cutscene: CCutsceneObject::ProcessControl's dead `step < 0.5` branch (only
      above 100 fps; patched like the ped-movement one). The shop, at every frame rate: the recompiler's compare-with-zero
      branches tested only the low 32 bits, so CPed::ProcessControl read bit 31 of the ped flags as bFadeOut and deleted
      the shopkeeper; his audio line was then dropped and the mission waited for it forever (PS2RECOMP_PATCHES.md).
      Check: `python tools/shakedown.py` (cutscene skipped, truck to the shop, the two gang members beaten, Vic through
      the door, shopkeeper alive and the loading screen gone; also a `regress.py` step). With the branch fix the gang
      members who start a fight outside the shop stay alive (the 32-bit test had faded them out too), so the mission now
      plays as written. Regression suite afterwards: missions, drive, evening, saves, tour, shakedown all ok; all 8
      scenes match the capture from before the change (`loading` / `pause_map` differ from the 2026-10-23 baseline
      before it too).
- [x] Vic falls through the world in some places - **no longer happens** at the spot the user saw it (user
      playtest 2026-10-24); fixed along the way by other work (which change is not known: the VU0 collision
      natives, the scheduler / timing work and the renderer changes all came in between). The original report:
      (reported by the user 2026-10-22, after the
      native renderer; not yet known whether it is new). Collision needs a look: whether the
      collision sectors / models are streamed in at those spots (CDSTREAM reads, IMG offsets),
      VU0 programs used by collision (`0x0000` in .vutext looked like line/sphere vs triangle
      tests, docs/game-internals.md "VU microcode"), and float edge cases in the recompiled code
      (FP contraction, round-to-zero, denormals). Compare with PS2X_HLE=0 to rule the renderer out.
- [x] Settings menu (F2) flickered between two layouts while the mouse sat between rows, and a click on a toggle
      (Skip intro movies) did not register - **fixed 2026-10-24**: the menu was an auto-sized, centred window whose
      help line grew and shrank with the hovered row, so the rows moved under a still mouse every other frame. Now a
      fixed-size window with a fixed-height help area (SETTINGS_MENU_WIDESCREEN.md "Menu v2"). Checked with real
      mouse / keyboard input (a script moving the cursor over the window, rows' boundary, clicks, arrows, Q / E,
      Escape). Settings locked by an environment variable (tools/run.py sets `VCS_SKIP_MOVIES=1`) now name it beside
      the label: that alone makes a click do nothing.
- [x] **Release check from a clean clone** (2026-10-28/29): the README's install (`git clone`, `build.py --recompile`)
      failed in a fresh folder - `unknown target 'ps2EntryRunner'`: recompile.py configures before generated code exists
      and build.py never configured again (dev trees were configured after `generated/ee` existed). Fixed in build.py.
      The first configure took 36 min, almost all of it toml11's test / docs submodules and full histories of three
      pinned dependencies: shallow, no submodules - a fresh configure 117 s (PS2RECOMP_PATCHES.md). The ThinLTO exe
      from the clone: full regression suite ok (scenes but the stale baseline's `loading` / `pause_map`, tour as the
      baseline - (-925, 1175) falling, the known spot -, 5 missions, drive, evening, saves, shakedown, widecull,
      menushape, controls 25/25); trainer 33/33 with all 110 vehicles. Two test fixes: the trainer's boost check ran
      into a hedge or a parked car in the Leaf Links garden (0.2 / 6.6 / 26.6 in three runs; now on open ground, 36.2
      three times), and the meters step's 30 fps reference varies 28.2-30.6 between runs (tolerance 5% -> 10%; the bug
      it guards against was 4.8x). Started on its own (the README's "Play"), vcs.exe ran the software GS at ~5 fps:
      only run.py and the test tools set `PS2X_GS=hw`, the runtime's default is cpu. The launcher now defaults to hw
      (`PS2X_GS=cpu` still picks the software path); a start without run.py's environment: D3D11, movies 0 dropped.
      The tools no longer set it either (they run the exe's own defaults), and the exe is now `build/vcs.exe` with
      its DLLs and vcs.ini (DECISIONS.md 2026-10-29). Fort Baxter gameplay with no PS2X_* / VCS_* set: gs_draws 0,
      vu1_programs 0, native sound, emulated IOP off, render worker on, 60 fps at the default cap.
- [x] Last Stand (DIA_C5, the story's last mission): after the roof and the final cutscene, "Loading..." over black for
      good (user report 2026-10-29) - **fixed 2026-10-29** in the trainer. Not a hang: the game ran on behind a screen
      left faded out for the credits, which the story starts only when every chapter is done; the mission had been
      started from the trainer's list (the user's newest save is LOU_A3), so nothing faded it in. "Loading..." is the
      game's own text over the fade (F12 draw log), the same on a PS2. The trainer now rolls the game's credits after a
      Last Stand it launched (game-internals.md 11g, TRAINER.md); story flags untouched. A first version CALLed the
      credits from trainer bytecode: the CALL's packed return IP cannot point outside ScriptSpace, the RETURN went to
      garbage and the game loop stopped - now a script of its own at the subroutine (`vcs::rig::startScriptAt`). Check:
      `python tools/finale_check.py --full` (9 checks, 0 failed: credits, back below the Mendez building, faded in) and
      `--story` (the story's own credits, one copy only).
- [x] White lines across the picture in the morning, from the planes' trails in the sky (user report 2026-10-30, seen
      after the Linux work but not caused by it: at 4:3 too, in every renderer path, with either frame timing) -
      **fixed 2026-10-30** in the recompiler. Its `VCLIPw` had the + / - clip bits swapped and compared with w, not
      |w|; RenderWare's Im3D line clipper (EE, `FUN_002F95E0`) then cut a trail segment leaving the view at the
      opposite side plane, next to the camera, and the wrapped projection drew across the screen (game-internals.md
      6k). One generated function changed. Check: `VCS_SELFTEST=1` (12 clip-flag cases); at the Little Havana Empire
      site at 08:20 the F12 dumps had a near-camera line vertex (Q ~8.9) every frame at 4:3 and 16:9, none after.

## Phase 6 - enhancements

- **Player settings** (2026-10-28, asked for by the user; roadmap milestone 8): every control rebindable - keyboard and
  mouse buttons / wheel with two slots per PS2 button and stick direction, a walk key, the gamepad's button map, stick
  deadzones, camera speed, trigger point, swapped sticks, inverted camera, a mouse camera (mouse speed as the right
  stick) with sensitivity / invert; the game's own vibration on the gamepad (it was dropped by the pad stub; 0-200%);
  master / movie volume and mono / swapped output; vertical sync (off / on / tearing for VRR); a frame-rate counter;
  mute or pause in the background; presets (Authentic, Enhanced, Widescreen light) and Reset all settings
  (docs/CONTROLS.md, SETTINGS_MENU_WIDESCREEN.md "Player settings"). `tools/controls_check.py`: 21 checks, 0 failed;
  regress step "controls". Defaults unchanged (the old fixed mapping, mouse camera off, vibration as on the PS2).
- **Mouse look and driving keys** (2026-10-29, asked for by the user): on foot the mouse turns the follow camera itself
  (heading written in the game with the camera's source points, pitch through the stick's pitch speed with the game's
  stick curve undone; exact amounts, no top speed for the heading), in other cameras it is the right stick past the
  game's dead third; Mouse camera on by default, forward looks up. While driving W / S / Space are Cross / Square / R1
  (accelerate, brake, handbrake) and do nothing else; lean on Keypad 8 / 5 (Keyboard > Driving, a key group of its own).
  Right click (R1) locks on, checked. game-internals.md 12a / 12b (the stick curve, three pad reads a frame, the
  follow camera FUN_0029dab0), DECISIONS.md. `tools/controls_check.py`: 36 checks, 0 failed (11 new: mouse heading /
  pitch / invert / off, the pause menu, lock-on, driving keys, lean rebind, W drives and Space stops the car, the mouse
  on the vehicle camera, mouse look after leaving the car).
- **Music / sound effects volume** (2026-10-28, asked for by the user): Audio > Music and Sound effects are the game's
  own levels, in step with its pause menu both ways and kept across save loads (game-internals.md 9c). controls_check
  checks that the levels reach the game and its prefs, a save load keeps them, and the pause menu's slider changes the
  setting; saves.py ok. A Voices volume (speech scaled in the native driver) was removed again the same day.
- [x] **Load Game hang** (found 2026-10-28 by the controls check, fixed the same day): after the check's binding /
  preset / menu / vibration steps in the city, Load Game from the pause menu sat on "Loading..." for ~45 s and then the
  game thread returned to 0x4548435F from the script VM (ra 0x256164). The trainer's god mode (on for the vibration
  step) kept the address of its last tick script's slot; the load fills that slot with one of the save's scripts, and
  the trainer, seeing it active while the clock stood still, took it out of the active list mid-load. A slot is now
  ours only while its IP is in the slot's own code (`vcs::rig::scriptActive`, game-internals.md 11d). The controls
  check's flow with the load at its old place: stuck on "Loading..." 2 of 2 before, fine after (the trainer's slot
  was taken by the load: logged). `tools/saves.py` (regress `saves`) now loads with god mode on: before the fix its
  load failed (stuck on "Loading...", the player never back at the save), after it passes with the slot taken logged.

- **Full screen** (2026-10-27, asked for by the user): Display > Window mode (Windowed / Full screen, borderless at
  the desktop's resolution) and Alt+Enter; the cursor hides after 2 s still in full screen; hidden test runs no longer
  write vcs.ini (SETTINGS_MENU_WIDESCREEN.md "Full screen").

- **Ultrawide** (2026-10-27, asked for by the user): Aspect ratio 21:9, 32:9 and Match window (the window's own
  shape, 4:3 .. 32:9, followed live). Checked with the reference scenes and city drives at 21:9 / 32:9 (picture, HUD,
  cutscene bars, culling and streaming at the edges); regress step "widecull" covers 21:9 and 32:9. At 32:9 3840x1080
  the render worker costs about twice 16:9 1920x1080 (busiest bench spot 97 fps, drive 103) - details in
  SETTINGS_MENU_WIDESCREEN.md "Ultrawide".
  Same day: the pause menu and loading screens sit inside the game's frame at 4:3 (between the bars of a 32:9 game on
  a 16:9 monitor), the pause menu switches to 4:3 at once, and no frame is squeezed for one shape and shown in the
  other (SETTINGS_MENU_WIDESCREEN.md). Then the shifted frame at the switch (VCS shows the previous frame, so the shape
  now follows the displayed picture; checked with every presented frame captured).
  Also: the integer Internal resolutions render wider in widescreen (1x at 32:9 is 1707x448; `PS2X_HW_WIDE_SCALE=0`
  = before), and the radar's streak of map beside its circle at 32:9 is gone (the HUD layer squeezed before rounding to
  PS2 pixels).

- **Widescreen culling at the screen edges** (2026-10-27, reported by the user): at 16:9 / 16:10 buildings, peds and
  cars in the outer part of the picture were culled as if the screen were 4:3 - `CCamera::IsSphereVisible` tests
  side planes built from the FOV alone, not from the widened view window (game-internals.md 5). The planes are now
  widened to the Hor+ edge before each test (`src/game/vcs_display.cpp`, `VCS_WIDE_CULL=0` = the game's planes).
  Sector culling was already right. Checked: plane edge = view window x at 16:9 (0.9336) and 16:10 (0.8402),
  regress step "widecull" (fails with `VCS_WIDE_CULL=0`: 0.7002); spheres passing the test at 16:9 +8-25% over the
  three bench spots; 4:3 untouched (the wrapper returns before reading memory).

- **Trainer** (2026-10-26, docs/TRAINER.md): an RDR2 Native Trainer style menu (F5 / Back + RB) - god mode, never
  wanted, wanted level, money, every weapon and loadouts, unlimited ammo, no reload, spawning all 110 vehicles,
  vehicle invincibility / repair / flip / boost / paint, teleports to 13 districts and a saved position, time,
  freeze time, weather, game speed. `tools/trainer_check.py`: 30 checks, 0 failed (with all 110 vehicles).
  Mission launcher added the same day: 59 story missions by title, five side jobs (in their vehicle); 33 checks, 0
  failed.
- **Free camera and Hide HUD** in the trainer (2026-10-30, docs/TRAINER.md "Camera", F6 / Back + LB): the active
  CCam written after the game's update of it (game-internals.md 12b), real-time speed (20 m/s: 50.7 m in 2.5 s at 30 fps,
  40.3 m in 2 s at 60 fps), the world streamed in 640 m from the player, works driving and in cutscenes, "Teleport
  player here"; Hide HUD skips CHud::Draw. `VCS_FREECAM=0`: the game's camera untouched (checked). `trainer_check.py`
  40 checks (the one failure the check's own flight path, fixed); `--freecam`: 7 checks, 0 failed.
  Same day: a mission launched under it hung on "Loading..." (the first version replaced the camera's update, which
  drives a cutscene's end); fixed, and a launch turns it off. `--freecam` 8 checks (Soldier's cutscene played out
  under it), 0 failed; the full check 41, 0 failed.

## Milestone 9 - Linux (started 2026-10-30)

Native Linux as a second platform (the user's request; the Steam Deck postponed): docs/LINUX.md has the build, the
differences and the work list. Written and syntax-checked on the Linux laptop (GCC 13 for checking; the build itself
needs the packages `build.py --check-deps` lists, clang 20 among them):
- toolchain: clang 19+ found by `tools/toolchain.py`, clang-cl's flags for clang (`ReleaseMode.cmake`, incl.
  `-fno-strict-aliasing`), compile / ThinLTO jobs capped by memory, `--check-deps`;
- host / runtime: exe folder, XDG data folder, the LP64 `long` spots (`fseek`, IOP `strtol`), `_BitScanForward`,
  control socket SIGPIPE / reuse, card birth time, rig kill and copy;
- renderer: RHI backend choice (`VCS_RHI`, Graphics > Graphics API), a null backend, the **Vulkan backend**
  (`src/rhi/vulkan/rhi_vulkan.cpp`), HLSL -> SPIR-V through glslang (`tools/hlsl_spirv.py`; all 15 shaders pass
  `spirv-val`), Dear ImGui through the RHI (`render/ui_renderer.cpp`);
- debugging: crash handler on signals (tested), SIGPROF profiler.
Not run in the game yet: first build, then the checks in docs/LINUX.md (generated code equal to Windows', bit-exact
HLE / VU0, scenes against the Windows reference, the rig).

## Milestone 9 - distribution: the launcher and releases (2026-10-30)

The user's request: a launcher in releases that finds the game, builds and launches it (Windows first), with the
Python scripts still usable on their own. docs/LAUNCHER.md has the whole of it; DECISIONS.md 2026-10-30 the choices.
- [x] Tools: `@vcs {json}` events with failure codes (toolchain), `build.py --recompile-if-needed / --progress json /
      --launcher`, `generated/recompile_stamp.json` + `recompile.py --check`, `build/build_info.json`, `doctor.py`,
      `vcs_disc.py check`, `setup_vs.py`, `backup.py`, `report.py`, `rip_disc.py`, `deps.py`, `release.py`,
      `update.py`; `find_iso` reads `build/vcs.ini` too (vcs.exe's); vcs.exe's exit codes per failure
      (`src/disc/vcs_disc_id.h`, shared with the launcher).
- [x] `launcher/`: VCSLauncher.exe (SDL3 + Dear ImGui, static, 4 MB): the four steps, the next-step button, tasks with
      stages / progress / cancel / errors and fixes, play with the log, saves backup / restore, shortcut, report,
      updates, options; command line `--check / --build / --play / --self-test / --screenshot`.
- [x] Releases: `tools/release.py` (82 MB zip: source, launcher, embeddable Python, `deps/`, licences; the game-file
      guard), offline configure from `deps/` (`FETCHCONTENT_FULLY_DISCONNECTED`, the FFmpeg URL - a `[gta-recomp]`
      CMake change), CI workflow `.github/workflows/launcher.yml` (written, not run yet).
- [x] Checked: from the release zip in an empty folder, the hidden launcher built the game from scratch (bundled Python,
      no downloads) in 8 min 42 s, and `--play` started it (the intro movie, 0 dropped); update 0.1.0 -> 0.1.1 in place; backups round-trip on a card copy;
      setup_vs.py dry runs and the Microsoft-signature check; a disc copy from an image file.
- [ ] A PC with nothing installed (Windows Sandbox): setup_vs.py's real install. A real DVD drive. CI's first run and
      the first tagged release. Code signing.

## Useful switches
| Env var | Effect |
|---|---|
| `PS2X_GS=cpu\|hw\|gpu\|null` | GS renderer (vcs.exe: default hw, set by src/main.cpp; the runtime's own default cpu) |
| `PS2X_HW_SCALE=n`, `PS2X_HW_DEBUG=1` | hardware renderer scale / stats |
| `VCS_FPS_LOG=1` | VBlanks and flips per second (was `VCS_FPS=1`; `VCS_FPS` is the frame rate cap) |
