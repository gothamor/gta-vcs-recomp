# Decisions log

Newest at the bottom. Each entry: what, why, and what would change it.

## 2026-10-21 - Base toolchain: vendored PS2Recomp
- PS2Recomp (ran-j, GPL-3.0) is vendored into `third_party/PS2Recomp` at upstream
  commit in `third_party/PS2Recomp/UPSTREAM_COMMIT`, without its `.git`,
  `android/` and `vita/` folders. Vendored (not a submodule) because we will patch
  the runtime heavily and can't publish a fork from here. Keep local changes
  small and listed in `docs/PS2RECOMP_PATCHES.md` so they can be upstreamed.
- The project is GPL-3.0 as a result.

## 2026-10-21 - Distribution: source only, bring your own disc
- The repo never contains the ISO, the ELF, or C++ generated from the ELF
  (`.gitignore` blocks them). Users run the pipeline on their own disc.
- The built exe reads game files straight from the user's ISO at runtime.
- Only one executable build is supported (SHA-1 in `tools/vcs_disc.py`).

## 2026-10-21 - Performance is a hard requirement
- Upstream runtime uses raylib + a CPU software GS renderer, which the upstream
  README calls "very bad" for speed. That's fine for bring-up only.
- Target: runs full speed on old/modest hardware (dev box: i7-7700K + GTX 1080 Ti,
  treat it as the *high* end). So:
  - GS: hardware-accelerated renderer (Vulkan/D3D), not a CPU rasterizer and
    preferably not a heavy compute rasterizer either. paraLLEl-GS is an option
    for reference accuracy, but the end state is a native renderer fed directly
    from the game's draw calls (HLE of VU1 programs).
  - VU1: translate the game's microprograms to C++ ahead of time, never interpret.
  - Disc I/O: memory-map the ISO, no per-read file opens.
  - Avoid per-instruction runtime dispatch in hot paths (e.g. indirect jumps
    through lookup tables) where we can resolve statically.
