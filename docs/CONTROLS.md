# Controls

Keyboard, mouse and a gamepad (anything SDL3 knows: Xbox, DualShock / DualSense, Switch Pro, ...) all drive the
same PS2 controller (DualShock 2, analog mode), so they can be mixed. Every binding can be changed in the settings
menu (F2): the **Keyboard** and **Gamepad** pages (src/game/vcs_input.cpp).

## Default bindings

| PS2 | Keyboard / mouse | Gamepad |
|---|---|---|
| Left stick | W A S D | Left stick |
| Right stick (camera) | I J K L, the mouse | Right stick |
| D-pad | Arrow keys | D-pad |
| Cross | Shift | A / Cross |
| Square | Space | X / Square |
| Triangle | F | Y / Triangle |
| Circle | Ctrl, left mouse button | B / Circle |
| L1 | Q | LB |
| R1 | E, right mouse button | RB |
| L2 | 1, Z | LT |
| R2 | 3, X | RT |
| L3 / R3 | C / V | stick clicks |
| Start | Enter | Start / Menu |
| Select | Backspace | Back / View |
| Walk (hold) | - (unbound) | - (a small stick tilt) |

**While driving** (Keyboard page, Driving) these keys do what a PC driving game does, and nothing else meanwhile; on
foot they keep their bindings above (W walks, Space jumps):

| Driving | Keyboard | PS2 |
|---|---|---|
| Accelerate | W | Cross |
| Brake / reverse | S | Square |
| Handbrake | Space | R1 |
| Lean forward / nose down (bikes, aircraft) | Keypad 8 | Left stick up |
| Lean back / nose up | Keypad 5 | Left stick down |

Steering stays on A / D (the left stick); Shift still accelerates and E / the right mouse button is still R1. The
game's own PS2 controls apply on top. Start or Cross (Enter / Shift) skips the intro movie; the Rockstar logos before
it can't be skipped, as on the PS2 (Game > Skip intro movies skips both).

**Right mouse button = R1**: on foot it locks on to the ped nearest in front while held (with fists or a weapon), as R1
does on the PS2; left mouse button (Circle) attacks / fires. With **Free aim** on (below) it aims a gun instead.

## Free aim

Keyboard > **Free aim** (off by default) and Gamepad > **Free aim** (off), each for its own device (src/game/vcs_aim.cpp,
game-internals.md 12c):

- With a gun in hand (pistols, shotguns, SMGs, rifles, the M249, minigun and flame-thrower), holding the target button
  (R1's binding: the right mouse button / E; on the gamepad R1's button, RB unless changed) puts up the game's own
  white aiming circle in the middle of the screen instead of locking on to the nearest person. The mouse (or the right
  stick, 2 rad/s at full tilt, finer near the centre) turns the aim and the camera with it, 1:1 like the camera on foot
  (Mouse sensitivity, Invert mouse up / down apply; zoomed views turn slower).
- The left button (Circle) fires **through the circle**: a shot hits what is under it, whatever the gun's own line.
  Firing a gun from the hip with the left button aims too (the aim is held 0.6 s after the last shot).
- **Moving while aiming** is what the game allows locked on with that gun - a pistol walks and strafes; no new movement
  is added. Letting go leaves the camera looking where the aim did.
- Fists, melee weapons, thrown weapons and the scoped guns (sniper rifles, rocket launcher, camera, binoculars) keep
  R1 as on the PS2. There is no aim assist on the gamepad.
- It is the game's own free aim (R1 then L3 on the PS2: the left stick moves an aiming point while Vic stands still),
  driven so that Vic can move and the mouse aims; `VCS_FREEAIM=0` leaves it out entirely.

**In the scopes** (sniper rifles, rocket launcher, M16 view, camera, binoculars) the mouse turns the view itself, 1:1,
with Mouse camera on (zoomed in it turns slower). **Mouse wheel** (Keyboard page, on by default): on foot down is the
next weapon and up the previous one (R2 / L2, one per notch); in the sniper scope, the camera and binoculars it zooms.
It does nothing of this while a control is bound to the wheel, while driving or while aiming.

## Keyboard page

- Every PS2 button, both sticks' directions and **Walk** have two slots. Click a slot, then press a key, a mouse
  button (left, right, middle, 4, 5) or turn the wheel (each notch is a short press); Esc cancels, a right-click on a
  slot clears it. Shift / Ctrl / Alt bind both sides, Enter is also Keypad Enter.
- A key does one thing: binding it to a control takes it from the control that had it. The menu keys (Settings menu
  F2, Trainer F5, Free camera F6, same page) never take a control's key, and a control can't take theirs - the menu says which setting
  has it.
- **Walk (hold)**: the left stick at the **Walking speed** (45% by default) while held - GTA walks below about half
  a tilt, which keys can't do otherwise.
- **A driving key** may share its key with an on-foot control (W is Move forward on foot and Accelerate in a car); within
  the Driving section a key does one thing, and the menu keys stay out of both.
- **Mouse camera** (on by default): the mouse turns the camera, and the mouse is held in the window while playing (free
  in the menus and when the window is in the background). **On foot** it turns the camera itself, as in a PC game:
  every movement turns it by the same angle at any speed and frame rate (100%: 400 counts - half an inch at 800 DPI -
  a radian), moving the mouse forward looks up. Looking up / down goes through the game's own stick pitch, which has a
  top speed (about 1.5 rad/s at 100%); a faster movement still arrives, a few frames later. **In the scopes and free
  aim** it turns the view itself too (above). **In vehicles and locked on** the mouse's speed becomes the right stick's
  tilt (1,500 counts a second is full tilt), so very fast flicks there turn no faster. **Mouse sensitivity**, **Invert
  mouse up / down**, **Free aim** and **Mouse wheel** (above). (game-internals.md 12b, 12c)

## Gamepad page

- **Buttons**: the gamepad input for each PS2 button (any button, LT / RT, stick clicks, D-pad, or none); several PS2
  buttons may share one.
- **Sticks and triggers**: deadzone per stick (12%; the range past it is stretched, so a small tilt beyond it still
  counts), **Camera speed** (the right stick's tilt scaled), **Trigger press point** (LT / RT are L2 / R2 buttons),
  **Swap sticks**, **Invert camera** left / right and up / down, **Free aim** (above; to aim with the left trigger,
  give R1 the LT and move L2 to another button).
- **Vibration**: the DualShock 2's motors on the gamepad's rumble, 0-200% (100% as on the PS2, 0% off). The game
  drives them itself (crashes, explosions, gunfire; game-internals.md 12a).

## Menus

F2 (or Back + Start on a gamepad) opens the settings, F5 (or Back + RB) the trainer (docs/TRAINER.md), F6 (or Back + LB)
turns the trainer's free camera on and off. Flying: W / A / S / D, E or Space up, Q down, mouse look, Shift faster,
Ctrl slower, Z / X zoom out / in; gamepad left stick, right stick, RT / LT, A / B, D-pad up / down (fixed keys; the
game gets no input meanwhile). In the
trainer: Up / Down or numpad 8 / 2 or the D-pad select, Left / Right or numpad 4 / 6 change a value, Enter / numpad
5 / A applies, Backspace / numpad 0 / Escape / B goes back (and closes it on the first page). The game gets no input
while a menu is open.

## Window

Alt+Enter switches between full screen and the window (Display > Window mode; saved in vcs.ini). Enter with Alt
held is not Start. Game > **In the background** decides what happens when another window is in front: keep running
(as before), mute, or pause.

## Debug keys
| Key | Effect |
|---|---|
| F3 | performance overlay: game fps and frame-time percentiles, EE thread time per phase (game / render / IOP / wait), GS and DMA counters, host frame and GPU submit times, audio buffer, and a frame-time graph; under it (beside it on a short screen) the game's state: the player's position, heading, state, health, armour, money and weapons, the vehicle (model, position, heading, health, speed), the camera (mode, position, heading, pitch, FOV), the clock, area, world level, game time, time step, pauses, pool use and the running scripts (the mission's with its IP). The same lines answer `python tools/gamectl.py gameinfo` |
| F4 | start / stop recording one CSV row per game frame to `perf_<date>_<time>.csv` (working directory); summarise with `python tools/perf_report.py <file>` |
| F12 | (hardware renderer) list the next frame's draws on stderr and dump its render targets |

## Test runs without a window
`python tools/run.py 600 test --hidden` starts the game with no window on the desktop, no sound, and the physical
keyboard / mouse / gamepad ignored (`PS2X_HIDDEN=1`). It listens on 127.0.0.1:47615 (`PS2X_CONTROL_PORT`) for
`tools/gamectl.py`: `screenshot out.png` (the picture plus the perf overlay, rendered off-screen), `press Return 150`,
`key W down` / `up` (also `mouseleft`, `mouseright`, `wheelup`, `rshift`, `kpenter`, ...), `perf`, `quit`, and from
the game layer `setting <key> [value]` (a setting read or changed; an action setting is pressed), `menu <page>` /
`menu scroll <0..1>` / `menu close` (the settings menu for screenshots), `padstate` (the last pad report the
bindings made, and the pad reads so far), `mouse <dx> <dy>` (mouse motion in counts, y down, as the mouse sends it),
`gamepad on|off`, `gamepad <a b x y lb rb back start ls rs up down left right> <0|1>`, `gamepad <lx ly rx ry lt rt>
<value>` (a gamepad set from the channel in place of the real one while on) and `aimstate` (free aim on or not, and
the shots sent down the camera line so far). `--control` (`PS2X_CONTROL=1`) opens the same channel with the window shown; `PS2X_INPUT=injected`
ignores physical input with the window shown. Injected keys go through the bindings like physical ones:
`tools/controls_check.py` checks them (also a `regress.py` step). `VCS_INPUT_MAP=0` falls back to the runtime's fixed
built-in mapping (`ps2_pad.cpp`, the old defaults).
