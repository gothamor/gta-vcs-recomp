// The trainer menu (docs/TRAINER.md): a list menu in the style of Red Dead Redemption 2's Native Trainer - a panel at
// the left of the screen with a header, the path to the current page, the rows (ON / OFF, < value >, > for a page)
// and a line of help for the selected row - over the game, plus short notifications of what was done. The trainer
// key (controls.trainer_key, F5) or Back + RB on a gamepad opens and closes it. Up / Down select, Left / Right
// change a value, Enter / A applies, Backspace / B goes back a page. While it is open the game gets no input.
// The actions are game/vcs_trainer.h's.
