// The trainer (docs/TRAINER.md): god mode, unlimited ammo, wanted level, money, weapons, vehicle spawning and repair,
// teleports to the city's districts, time / weather / game speed - for single-player fun, off unless used.
//
// What it does goes through the game's own script commands (MAIN.SCM opcodes, game-internals.md 11), run as a short
// script on the game's script VM between frames (vcs::rig::startCodeScript): the game applies them as its scripts
// would. Values that must hold (health under god mode, ammo, the clip under no reload, the vehicle's health) are
// written into the player's ped / vehicle at the frame kick every few frames while their toggle is on
// (game-internals.md 12). Trainer scripts start only while the game runs (its clock advances), and one still waiting
// when the game pauses is taken back out, so none can end up in a save. Names (vehicles, districts, weapons) come
// from the game's own text at run time.
//
// The menu is src/ui/trainer_menu.cpp. Control channel (tests): `trainer <command> [arg]` - see install().
