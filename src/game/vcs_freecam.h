// The trainer's free camera (docs/TRAINER.md "Camera"): fly anywhere while the game keeps running and the player stands

// CCamera::Process (FUN_00378dd8) runs the active camera's update, CCam::Process (FUN_00294540), then
// FUN_002a2ed0 (its height routines) on it, and builds the frame's camera - matrix, frustum, culling, streaming - from
// what that CCam left in its source / front / up / FOV (game-internals.md 12b). While the free camera flies the game's
// update still runs (a cutscene ends only when its camera has played its path: replacing the update hung missions on
// "Loading...", 2026-10-30), and the height routines are replaced for the active CCam: the free camera writes those
// fields there and returns. Off, it runs as before; VCS_FREECAM=0 does not hook it at all (the reference).
