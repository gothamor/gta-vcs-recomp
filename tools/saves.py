"""Memory card check through the game's own menus (milestone 2, docs/game-internals.md 10e).

    python tools/saves.py [OUT] [--port N]

One session from a copy of build/rig/saves/fortbaxter (slot 1 = "1 Soldier"):
  recover (Windows) a save planted as the card layer once stored "1 Kill Phil: Part 2" - an empty "1 Kill Phil" with
          the save in an NTFS stream - while slots 1 and 2 hold saves: at boot it is the file "3 Kill Phil%3A Part 2",
          the first free slot (game-internals.md 10f)
  save    "Kill Phil: Part 2" registered as the last mission passed (the save's name; a colon), then
          ACTIVATE_SAVE_MENU (script opcode 0x0260) -> Save Game -> slot 2 -> Yes (over "2 In the beginning"):
          "2 Kill Phil%3A Part 2" appears, whole
  load    pause menu -> Game -> Load Game -> slot 1 -> Yes, with trainer god mode on: slot 1 is read in full, the
          player is back in free roam
  delete  pause menu -> Game -> Delete Game -> slot 2 -> Yes: the slot file and its card-order entry are gone
  backup  the card was zipped into <data>/backups/auto-*.zip before the delete: the deleted slot is in it
Screenshots after every key press go to OUT (default build/saves); OUT/results.json holds the checks. Exit code 1
when one fails. Menu keys (CONTROLS.md): Shift = Cross, Return = Start, arrows = D-pad.
