"""Controls and player settings check (docs/CONTROLS.md, src/game/vcs_input.cpp): the bindings, checked in the pad
report they make and in the game, plus the settings registry's presets and reset, with menu screenshots.

    python tools/controls_check.py [OUT] [--port 47673]

Loads the Fort Baxter rig save (a copy, hidden), then: every default key binding (both slots, either Shift / Ctrl,
Keypad Enter, the mouse buttons) gives its PS2 button or stick direction, Alt+Enter is not Start; a rebound key moves
Vic and the old one no longer does; the walk key holds the stick at walking speed; the mouse turns the on-foot camera
by the amount asked (heading and pitch, inverted, off), right click locks on to a ped, the Driving keys (W / S / Space
accelerate, brake, handbrake in a car, and nothing else there), the mouse on the vehicle camera (turned 1:1, held while
the mouse moves, standing and driving, then back behind the car; the right stick takes it back at once), on foot again after
leaving the car; free aim (src/game/vcs_aim.cpp: the right button enters the game's free aim, the mouse turns it, a shot
hits a man on the aim line and not one beside it, Vic strafes while aiming, the camera stays where the aim looked, fists
and free aim off still lock on, the gamepad's RB and right stick, the sniper scope turned 1:1 and zoomed by the wheel,
the wheel changing weapons; in a car, the game's drive-by free aim as in Jive Drive: the left stick with free aim off,
the mouse / right stick with it on, the height limits, a shot through the circle, leaving the car; on foot, the game's
forced free aim as in Phil's shooting range: the same, the gamepad's R1 firing, the right button keeping it, the side
and height limits, the script's end; a gun on a vehicle as in Farewell To Arms: its camera turned by the mouse with no
jump to the left, the right stick and R1 with free aim on, the limits, a shot through the circle); a mouse wheel binding; a menu key
refuses a key a control has; the presets and Reset all settings; the screenshot key (F8) saves a PNG; screenshots of the settings menu's pages; Audio >
Music / Sound effects are the game's own levels (set here, shown in its pause menu, changed there, kept by a save
load) (src/game/vcs_volume.cpp). Results: OUT/summary.txt; screenshots OUT/*.png. Default
